<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Following the publication of this paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that certain of the western blotting data shown in Fig. 4B on p. 4988 had already appeared in an article written by different authors at different research institutes that had already been published. In addition, it appeared as if some of the control β‑actin protein bands had been re‑used in Fig. 3 on p. 4987, comparing between Fig. 3A and C.  Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been published prior to its submission to Molecular Medicine Reports, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: More than 50% of first cardiovascular events (CVE) occur in populations identified as at low or intermediate risk by the risk equations, so the inclusion of additional variables, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS), has been proposed to improve the predictive capacity of these equations. The aim of this study was to assess whether a PRS, independently or with clinical risk equations, is associated with the presence, severity and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHODS: 109 subjects with atherosclerosis were selected from the ILERVAS cohort (primary prevention) and matched with 109 participants without atherosclerosis of the same age, sex and SCORE2 risk level. Atherosclerosis was assessed and quantified by arterial wall vascular ultrasound in 12 territories, and PRS was estimated using the Cardio inCode Score®. The predictive capacity of the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis was estimated, as well as the association between the extent and severity of atherosclerosis with PRS and clinical risk (SCORE2).
RESULTS: PRS was similar between participants with or without atherosclerosis (P=0.525). We did not find an association between PRS and SCORE2 (r=-0.29, P=0.709), and the addition of PRS to SCORE2 did not improve the prediction of atherosclerosis [AUC (95% CI)=0.566 (0.477, 0.654), P=0.148]. The extent of atherosclerosis was related to SCORE2 (P=0.009), but not to PRS (P=0.709).
CONCLUSIONS: The Selected PRS is not associated with the presence of atherosclerosis or clinical risk, suggesting that its additional contribution to CVE risk would be mediated by mechanisms independent of the development of atherosclerosis. Additional biomarkers are needed to improve the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis without using imaging tests as a first step in personalized assessment.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:OBJECTIVE: To characterize the spatio-temporal association between features of the built environment and subclinical liver disease.
DESIGN: We used data from a large community-based population, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2002, N = 5542) with linked historical residential data that characterized past exposure to alcohol outlets (bars and liquor stores), healthy foods stores, and physical activity facilities (1990-2001). We examined whether and how past residential relate to hepatic steatosis (proxied by liver attenuation measured using computed tomography, with lower attenuation indicating higher hepatic steatosis). Hepatic steatosis is the most common.
RESULTS: We found significant associations between past residential exposure to neighborhood alcohol outlets, healthy food and physical activity resources, and hepatic steatosis. The spatial scale where the association between these features of the built environment and hepatic steatosis operate lies within 3 km (∼2 miles). The average association on liver attenuation per additional bar, liquor, healthy food store, and physical activity facility within a 2-mile buffer, were: -0.06 (95% CI -0.09, -0.03), -0.02 (95% CI -0.04, -0.009), 0.05 (95% CI 0.02, 0.07), 0.02 (95% CI 0.01, 0.04), respectively, in the preceding year of the measurement of hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the association and spatial scale remains consistent ten years prior to the measurement of hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that modifying neighborhood environments (decreasing alcohol outlets and improving access to healthy food and physical activity) may represent an effective population-wide approach to reduce liver-related morbidity.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of zedoarondiol on neovascularization of atherosclerotic (AS) plaque by exosomes experiment.
METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were fed with high-fat diet to establish AS model and treated with high- and low-dose (10, 5 mg/kg daily) of zedoarondiol, respectively. After 14 weeks, the expressions of anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS-1) and its receptor CD36 in plaques, as well as platelet activation rate and exosome-derived miR-let-7a were detected. Then, zedoarondiol was used to intervene in platelets in vitro, and miR-let-7a was detected in platelet-derived exosomes (Pexo). Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-let-7a mimics and treated with Pexo to observe the effect of miR-let-7a in Pexo on tube formation.
RESULTS: Animal experiments showed that after treating with zedoarondiol, the neovascularization density in plaques of AS mice was significantly reduced, THBS-1 and CD36 increased, the platelet activation rate was markedly reduced, and the miR-let-7a level in Pexo was reduced (P&lt;0.01). In vitro experiments, the platelet activation rate and miR-let-7a levels in Pexo were significantly reduced after zedoarondiol's intervention. Cell experiments showed that after Pexo's intervention, the tube length increased, and the transfection of miR-let-7a minics further increased the tube length of cells, while reducing the expressions of THBS-1 and CD36.
CONCLUSION: Zedoarondiol has the effect of inhibiting neovascularization within plaque in AS mice, and its mechanism may be potentially related to inhibiting platelet activation and reducing the Pexo-derived miRNA-let-7a level.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mediating role of inflammatory biomarkers in the causal effect of body composition on lipids and atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) study were used. Observational analyses were undertaken using data from 4717 children and adolescents aged 6-18 years from Chinese who underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for body composition. MR analyses were based on summary statistics from UK Biobank, deCODE2021, GLGC, FinnGen and other large consortiums. Inflammatory biomarkers included leptin, insulin, adiponectin, osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH).
RESULTS: In retrospective observational study, through osteocalcin, body composition had effects on total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). Conversely, fat mass vs. fat-free mass demonstrated opposing effects. Insulin played a role in the association of fat mass with TC and LDL (all P &lt; 0.05). Mediation MR results indicated the causal effect of fat-free mass on coronary atherosclerosis via insulin (indirect effect, OR (odds ratio): 0.95 [95%CI, 0.92-0.98]) and adiponectin (OR: 0.96 [95%CI, 0.93-0.99]). Adiponectin also mediated the causal association of fat mass with coronary heart disease (OR: 1.06 [95%CI, 1.02-1.10]) and coronary atherosclerosis (OR: 1.05 [95%CI, 1.01, 1.09]). Leptin, adiponectin and insulin played roles in mediating the casual effects of body composition on triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest different body composition exert varying influences on lipids and atherosclerosis through distinct inflammatory biomarkers. The findings may be helpful in tailoring management of body composition based on inflammatory biomarkers with different lipid profiles.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Creatine is a feed additive with physiological pleiotropic properties and also an energy homeostasis protector in vertebrates and is successfully used in terrestrial livestock and aquaculture. Here, two feeding trials were performed to investigate dietary creatine on endogenous creatine metabolism and physiological reprogramming in largemouth bass. The results showed that the endogenous creatine metabolism genes AGAT, GAMT, and SLC6A8 of largemouth bass are highly conserved with the amino acid sequences of other teleosts and are clustered separately from mammals. Among the 16 major tissues in largemouth bass, both creatine synthesis genes (agat, gamt) and transporter gene slc6a8 are most highly expressed in muscle. Muscle has a high threshold but sensitive creatine negative feedback to regulate endogenous creatine metabolism. Dietary creatine intake significantly inhibits endogenous creatine synthesis and transport in muscle in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect recovers with a decrease in dietary creatine content. In addition, physiological creatine saturation required prolonged exogenous creatine intake, and it would be shortened by high doses of creatine, which provides guidance for maximizing economic benefits in aquaculture. Metabolome and transcriptome showed that dietary creatine significantly affected the metabolism of the creatine precursor substance-arginine. Exogenous creatine intake spared arginine that would otherwise be used for creatine synthesis, increased arginine levels, and caused reprogramming of arginine metabolism. Overall, these results demonstrate that the addition of creatine to largemouth bass diets is safe and recoverable, and the benefits of creatine intake in largemouth bass are not limited to enhancing the function of creatine itself but also include a reduction in the metabolic burden of essential amino acids to better growth performance.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:In recent years, the widespread use of bisphenol compounds and microplastics (MP) have attracted attention due to their harmful effects. Here, individual and combined effects of MP and bisphenol compounds, were assessed on adult zebrafish after co-exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) and 25 μm polyethylene MP. Impacts on their offspring (the F1 generation) were also investigated. The reproductive toxicity in adult zebrafish impacted exerted by bisphenol compounds were aggravated by the co-presence of MP. Transcriptomics and metabolomics further showed single or co-exposure of bisphenol compounds and MP could together regulate apoptosis, calcium signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid signaling pathways. Our results also showed the different toxicity mechanisms on transcriptional and metabolic profiles in the combination effects of bisphenol compounds and MP. The co-exposure of BPA and MP predominantly influenced neurotoxicity via the MAPK signaling pathway and voltage-dependent calcium channels, whereas the co-exposure of BPS and MP principally affected visual development through phototransduction and retinol metabolism. The co-exposure of BPA and MP, as well as BPS and MP, specifically regulate lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in zebrafish offspring, respectively. Overall, this study provided a deep understanding of the toxicity differences between co-exposure and single exposure of bisphenol compound and MP in zebrafish, as well as the transgenerational effects and potential molecular mechanisms of bisphenol compounds and MP in zebrafish offspring.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Quan-du-zhong capsule (QDZ), derived from the whole plant extract of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used in treating vascular-related diseases, including hypertension and osteoporosis. Despite its established uses, its pro-angiogenic effects and underlying mechanisms require further investigation.
AIM OF THIS STUDY: This study aims to investigate the pro-angiogenic effects of QDZ and explore the underlying mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical compositions of QDZ, including its absorbed prototypes in rats, were analyzed using UHPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. The pro-angiogenic activities of QDZ were evaluated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through various assays, including CCK-8, migration, scratch, tubule formation, and 3D sprouting assays. Additionally, the pro-angiogenic effects of QDZ were further assessed in vivo through the matrigel plug assay and a hindlimb ischemia-reperfusion model, with three-dimensional blood flow visualized via micro-CT. A comprehensive approach involving network pharmacology, molecular docking, transcriptomics, and proteomics was utilized to explore the pro-angiogenic mechanism of QDZ, with validation by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: QDZ significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and tubule formation of HUVECs. The matrigel plug assay further confirmed its pro-angiogenic potential. In vivo, QDZ-treated mice displayed enhanced vascular distribution and faster blood flow recovery post-ischemia-reperfusion. Chemical analysis identified 49 compounds in QDZ, with 16 absorbed prototypes detected in rat plasma. Mechanistic investigations through network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and proteomics suggested that QDZ's pro-angiogenic effects were mediated through the VEGFA/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, with increased phosphorylation of angiogenesis-related proteins such as PI3K, Akt, FAK, and Src.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that QDZ promotes angiogenesis via activating the VEGFA and its downstream PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin its traditional medicinal use in vascular health.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Accumulation of coumarins plays key roles in response to immune and abiotic stress in plants, but the genetic adaptation basis of controlling coumarins in perennial woody plants remain unclear.
RESULTS: We detected 792 SNPs within 334 genes that were significantly associated with the phenotypic variations of 15 single-metabolic traits and multiple comprehensive index, such as principal components (PCs) of coumarins metabolites. Expression quantitative trait locus mapping uncovered that 337 eQTLs associated with the expression levels of 132 associated genes. Selective sweep revealed 55 candidate genes have potential selective signature among three geographical populations, highlighting that the coumarins biosynthesis have been encountered forceful local adaptation. Furthermore, we constructed a genetic network of seven candidate genes that coordinately regulate coumarins biosynthesis, revealing the multiple regulatory patterns affecting coumarins accumulation in Populus tomentosa. Validation of candidate gene variations in a drought-tolerated population and DUF538 heterologous transformation experiments verified the function of candidate genes and their roles in adapting to the different geographical conditions in poplar.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the genetic regulation of the coumarins metabolic biosynthesis of Populus, and offered potential clues for drought-tolerance evaluation and regional improvement in woody plants.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Artemisia selengensis Turcz is a perennial herb belonging to the genus Artemisia in the family Asteraceae. Known for its nutrient richness, distinct flavor, and medicinal properties, Artemisia selengensis Turcz. has garnered attention. However, its efficacy, particularly in alleviating hepatic injury, remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of the 50% ethanol extract of Artemisia selengensis Turcz. (ASTE) in a mouse model of Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)-induced liver injury. Through multi-omics analysis, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and intestinal flora examination, we explored the pathways and key targets of ASTE in treating liver injury. Network pharmacology further identified the crucial components of ASTE for liver injury treatment. Our findings indicate that ASTE affects intestinal flora such as Adlercreutzia through flavonoids, particularly naringin and epicatechin. Additionally, key genes in the PPAR pathway, such as Fabp3, Fabp5, Ehhadh, and Pltp, influence glycerophospholipid metabolism, contributing to liver injury amelioration. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ASTE's hepatoprotective effects, laying the groundwork for its potential application as a functional food.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:We aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma proteins and metabolites and the occurrence of future strokes using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics as well as to identify other biomarkers that could predict stroke risk in hypertensive patients. In a nested case-control study, baseline plasma samples were collected from 50 hypertensive subjects who developed stroke and 50 gender-, age- and body mass index-matched controls. Plasma untargeted metabolomics and data independent acquisition-based proteomics analysis were performed in hypertensive patients, and 19 metabolites and 111 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Integrative analyses revealed that molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of protein digestion and absorption, salivary secretion, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton, along with significant metabolic suppression. C4BPA, Caprolactam, Col15A1, and HBB were identified as predictors of stroke occurrence, and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was determined to be the optimal predictive model by integrating six machine-learning classification models. The SVM model showed strong performance in both the internal validation set (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.977, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.941-1.000) and the external independent validation set (AUC: 0.973, 95% CI: 0.921-0.999).</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Accurately predicting druggable genes is of paramount importance for enhancing the efficacy of targeted therapies, reducing drug-related toxicities and improving patients' survival rates. Nevertheless, accurately predicting candidate cancer-druggable genes remains a critical challenge in translational medicine due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cancer data. In this study, we proposed a novel graph neural approach called Druggable Gene Discovery based on the Integration of Multi-omics Data and the Multi-view Network (MDMNI-DGD), aiming to predict and evaluate cancer-druggable genes. MDMNI-DGD integrated a comprehensive set of multi-omics data, including copy number variations, DNA methylation, somatic mutations, and gene expression profiles. Simultaneously, it constructed the multi-view gene association network based on protein-protein interactions (PPI), protein structural domains, gene co-expression, pathway co-occurrence, gene sequence and gene ontology. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, MDMNI-DGD exhibits excellent performance in key evaluation metrics such as AUROC and AUPR. Moreover, the case study has also demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in discovering potentially druggable genes. Among more than 20,000 protein-coding genes, MDMNI-DGD successfully identified 872 potentially druggable genes. The findings from this investigation may serve to bolster the assessment of pan-cancer druggable genes, potentially catalyzing the development of more personalized and efficacious therapeutic interventions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear whether specific compounds within PM<sub>2.5</sub>, rather than the overall mass, serve as a better indicator of adverse cardiovascular health outcomes associated with air pollution.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 3257 participants (aged 37-51 years) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its constituent compounds, black carbon (BC), ammonium, nitrate, organic matter, sulfate, mineral dust, and sea salt were included in the analyses. Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT; the average of common, bulb, and internal carotid) was measured by carotid ultrasonography. We assessed the cross-sectional associations of one-year exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its compounds with mean cIMT using linear regression models adjusting for participants' demographics, individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status, behavioral components, and health conditions. We also adopted Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to investigate the association between the PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound mixture and cIMT as well as the contribution of each compound to the association.
RESULTS: Greater exposure to BC was associated with higher cIMT (mm) (β =0.034, 95 % CI = 0.019-0.049, per IQR increase [0.56 μg/m3] of BC) among participants with a mean age of 45.0, consisting of 45.9 % Black and 54.1 % White males and females. The association was generally consistent across participants' demographic characteristics. In our BKMR analysis, BC exhibited a dose-response association with cIMT with a high contribution to the association of cIMT with PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound as a mixture (posterior inclusion probability [PIP]: 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that certain compounds of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, such as BC, may offer more reliable indications of the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Domoic acid is a neurotoxin secreted by the marine diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia during toxic algal bloom events. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are exposed to domoic acid through the ingestion of fish that feed on toxic diatoms, resulting in domoic acid toxicosis (DAT), which can vary from mild to fatal. Sea lions with mild disease can be treated if toxicosis is detected early after exposure. Therefore, rapid diagnosis of DAT is essential but also challenging. In this work, we performed multiomics analyses, specifically proteomic and lipidomic, on blood samples from 31 California sea lions. Fourteen sea lions were diagnosed with DAT based on clinical signs and post-mortem histological examination of brain tissue, and 17 had no evidence of DAT. Proteomic analyses revealed 31 statistically significant proteins in the DAT individuals compared to the non-DAT individuals (adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Of these proteins, 19 were decreased in the DAT group of which three were apolipoproteins that are known to transport lipids in the blood, prompting lipidomic analyses. In the lipidomic analyses, 331 lipid species were detected with high confidence and multidimensional separations, and 29 were found to be statistically significant (adjusted p &lt; 0.05 and log2(FC) &lt; -1 or &gt;1) in the DAT versus non-DAT comparison. Of these, 28 were lower in the DAT individuals, while only 1 was higher. Furthermore, 15 of the 28 lower concentration lipids were triglycerides, illustrating their putative connection with the perturbed apolipoproteins and potential use in rapid DAT diagnoses.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:The orphan nuclear receptor Nr4a1 has complex biological functions and has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease. While protective in atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, Nr4a1 has been shown to cause cardiac fibrosis in non-ischemic adverse remodeling of the heart. However, mechanisms underlying these actions are still poorly understood. Accordingly, we sought to: (1) understand the contribution of Nr4a1 to the inflammatory environment including macrophage phenotype; and (2) determine the contribution of Nr4a1 to cardiac fibroblast phenotype in the fibrotic heart. Wild type and Nr4a1-/- mice were infused with angiotensin II (1500 ng/kg/min) to induce cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. Nr4a1 deletion prevented cardiac fibrosis and maintained normal diastolic function. We determined that macrophages lacking Nr4a1 had distinctly different phenotypes to wild type macrophages, with Nr4a1 deletion preventing the induction of a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, instead promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This had functional consequences in that macrophages lacking Nr4a1 showed a reduced ability to induce cardiac fibroblast migration. Interestingly, deletion of Nr4a1 in isolated cardiac fibroblasts also had profound effects on their phenotype and function, with these cells not able to produce excess extracellular matrix proteins, convert to a myofibroblast phenotype, or respond to macrophage stimuli. Nr4a1 causes cardiac fibrosis and subsequent diastolic dysfunction by inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and by pushing cardiac fibroblasts towards a pro-fibrotic phenotype in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli. Nr4a1 is also critical for macrophage/fibroblast interactions.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Multi-omics studies have shown that strigolactone modulates phenolic acid accumulation in the leaves of R. chrysanthum and can enable it to cope with UV-B stress. UV-B stress is an abiotic stress that plants will inevitably suffer during growth and can seriously affect the normal physiological state of plants. Strigolactone, a phytohormone, has been less studied and it is important to investigate its regulation of plant growth under UV-B radiation. In the present study, we investigated the changes in leaves of Rhododendron chrysanthum Pall. (R. chrysanthum) under UV-B radiation. The leaves of R. chrysanthum were collected for widely targeted metabolomics, hormonomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and acetylated proteomics assays. The results showed that the leaves of R. chrysanthum were able to produce a large amount of differential phenolic acids with antioxidant effects under UV-B stress, the content of strigolactone was significantly elevated, and the genes and proteins involved in phenolic acid biosynthesis and strigolactone biosynthesis were significantly altered, and some of the proteins (ASP1, 4CLL7, and CCD1) underwent acetylation modification. Meanwhile, correlation analysis showed that strigolactone was strongly correlated with differential phenolic acids, which might regulate the adaptive responses of the R. chrysanthum under UV-B stress. In this paper, we investigated the effects of strigolactone on the accumulation of phenolic acid compounds and found a strong correlation between strigolactone and elevated phenolic acid levels, which provided insights into the molecular mechanism of plant regulation of phenolic acid accumulation, and facilitated the adoption of measures to mitigate the adverse effects of UV-B stress on plant growth, and to achieve the purpose of protecting plant germplasm resources.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Vascular stent intervention is a pivotal treatment for coronary atherosclerosis, though in-stent thrombosis remains a significant postoperative complication with an unclear underlying mechanism. This study utilized dissipated particle dynamics analysis to investigate the impact of stent and its injury on platelet behavior. The findings suggest that thrombus formation upstream of the stent is mainly initiated by upstream arterial injury, which leads to increased platelet accumulation and activation in that area. While thrombosis downstream of the stent is more directly influenced by the stent itself. The morphology and size of in-stent thrombosis can vary significantly due to the different contributions of the stent and underlying injuries. Additionally, the volume of in-stent thrombosis is affected by the extent of the injury and the viscosity of platelets, showing a notable increase in volume with the lengthening of the injury area and rise in platelet viscosity. This study provides a novel theoretical framework for optimizing stent placement strategies and structural designs by examining the effects of stent struts and associated injuries on thrombus formation.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Podophyllotoxin (PPT), a highly active compound extracted from the rhizome of Dysosma versipellis (DV), has been used as an effective anti-cancer drug clinically since the 1950s. It possesses various biological activities, including antiviral and antitumor effects. However, its clinical application is severely limited due to its hepatotoxicity, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity using tandem quality tag (TMT) based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics, providing potential targets and directions for developing new therapeutic strategies to facilitate the safe and rational use of podophyllotoxin in clinical settings.
METHODS: We employed a comprehensive assessment of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity based on the Toxicology Evidence Chain (TEC) concept, originally proposed by our research group in 2018. This approach involves a tiered search for evidence of Harmful Ingredients Evidence (HIE), Injury Phenotype Evidence (IPE), Adverse Outcomes Evidence (AOE), and Toxic Events Evidence (TEE) during the development of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity, thereby constructing a guiding toxicology evidence chain. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered 20 mg/kg PPT for 4 consecutive days (HIE). Indicators such as hepatic function, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, as well as the histopathology of liver tissue were evaluated to assess liver damage and synthetic function (AOE). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics were conducted to systematically assess PPT-induced hepatotoxicity at the level of modified proteins and verify the molecular mechanisms of key molecular pathways (TEE1). Furthermore, in vitro THLE-2 cell models were used in conjunction with CCK8, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays to validate cytotoxicity and its underlying mechanisms (TEE2).
RESULTS: Our results showed that after 4 days of PPT administration at 20 mg/kg (HIE), serum levels of AST/ALT, TBA, TP, and ALB in SD rats were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05), indicating severe liver damage. SOD and T-AOC levels were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting an oxidative stress state. TNF-α levels were significantly elevated, while IL-10 and IL-3 levels were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05), indicating strong activation of the inflammatory response in the liver. Histopathological examination revealed liver sinusoidal congestion in the liver tissue (AOE). Omics analysis revealed that hepatotoxicity primarily affected the complement-pyroptosis and cGMP-PKG-autophagy pathways. Western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR results showed significant upregulation of complement-pyroptosis pathway proteins (C5a, C5aR, NLRP3) and cGMP-PKG-autophagy pathway proteins (PKG, mTOR) in the PPT group (P &lt; 0.05) (TEE1). In vitro cell experiments showed that PPT significantly reduced cell viability (P &lt; 0.05) and increased the expression of proteins associated with pyroptosis and autophagy pathways, including ROS, NLRP3, PKG, and mTOR (P &lt; 0.05) (TEE2).
CONCLUSION: PPT activates the complement system through the C5a/C5aR/ROS/NLRP3 pathway and induces the formation of inflammasomes, promoting pyroptosis. Simultaneously, PPT activates the cGMP-PKG pathway, inhibiting autophagy and further accelerating pyroptosis, ultimately leading to hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this study comprehensively revealed the underlying mechanisms of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity using the TEC concept. This approach transforms fragmented toxicity indicators into systematic evidence of toxicity, presenting a hierarchical progression of toxicity evidence and avoiding data accumulation in natural drug toxicology. Our findings represent a significant breakthrough in the elucidation of the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by podophyllotoxin.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Persistent immune activation is linked to elevated cardiovascular diseases in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The fat attenuation index (FAI) is a measure of peri-coronary inflammation that independently predicts cardiovascular disease risk in people without HIV. Whether FAI is associated with immune activation is unknown.
METHODS: Peripheral blood T-cell activation and homing phenotypes were measured in people with HIV (n=58) and people without HIV (n=16) without known cardiovascular disease who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography and had FAI measurements. A cross-sectional analysis of an observational cohort was performed. The primary aim was to evaluate associations of T-cell activation and phenotypes with the outcome variables, FAI values of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, which were assessed using multivariable regression models adjusted for age, natal sex, race, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, and use of lipid-lowering medication.
RESULTS: T cells from people with HIV showed greater activation, as measured by cluster of differentiation (CD) 38/human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype coexpression on CD4 central memory and terminally-differentiated effector memory subsets and on CD8 effector memory (TEM), than did cells from people without HIV. Expression of the chemokine receptor C-C Chemokine Receptor 2 was reduced on CD4 central memory and TEM and CD8 TEM and terminally-differentiated effector memory subsets in people with HIV. Among all participants, PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) in CD8 central memory was associated with worsened peri-coronary inflammation of the right coronary artery, whereas perforin/granzyme B on CD8 TEM was associated with improved peri-coronary inflammation of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery in adjusted analyses. When accounting for HIV serostatus, CD38/human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype coexpression on CD8 central memory, TEM, and terminally-differentiated effector memory cells was associated with more peri-coronary inflammation of the left anterior descending artery.
CONCLUSIONS: The associations between T-cell activation with FAI are novel and suggest that T-cell activation may be an important driver of peri-coronary inflammation, occurring at an early stage of atherosclerosis, even before the development of clinical disease.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), primarily caused by coronary atherosclerosis, initiates a series of events that culminate in the obstruction of coronary arteries, resulting in severe myocardial ischemia and hypoxia. The subsequent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury further aggravates cardiac damage, leading to a decline in heart function and the risk of life-threatening complications. The complex interplay of multiple regulated cell death (RCD) pathways plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AMI. Each RCD pathway is orchestrated by a symphony of molecular regulatory mechanisms, highlighting the dynamic changes and critical roles of key effector molecules. Strategic disruption or inhibition of these molecular targets offers a tantalizing prospect for mitigating or even averting the onset of RCD, thereby limiting the extensive loss of cardiomyocytes and the progression of detrimental myocardial fibrosis. This review systematically summarizes the mechanisms underlying various forms of RCD, provides an in-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of AMI through the lens of RCD, and highlights a range of promising therapeutic targets that hold the potential to revolutionize the management of AMI.</li>

<li><strong>Authors</strong>:Baldari S, Antonini A, Di Rocco G, Toietta G</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: The incidence of alcohol-associated cancers is higher within Asian populations having an increased prevalence of an inactivating mutation in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a mitochondrial enzyme required for the clearance of acetaldehyde, a cytotoxic metabolite of ethanol. The role of alcohol consumption in promoting lung cancer is controversial, and little attention has been paid to the association between alcohol drinking and pulmonary ALDH2 expression.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data available in public databases to elucidate the role of ALDH2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
RESULTS: Transcriptional and proteomic data indicate a substantial pulmonary expression of ALDH2, which is functional for the metabolism of alcohol diffused from the bronchial circulation. ALDH2 expression is higher in healthy lung tissue than in LUAD and inhibits cell cycle, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. Moreover, low ALDH2 mRNA levels predict poor prognosis and low overall survival in LUAD patients. Interestingly, ALDH2 expression correlates with immune infiltration in LUAD.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the role of ALDH2 in lung tumor progression and immune infiltration might support its potential use as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for improving immunotherapeutic response.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Breast cancer in the elderly presents distinct biological characteristics and clinical treatment responses compared with cancer in younger patients. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is recommended for evaluating treatment efficacy in elderly cancer patients based on physiological classification. However, research on molecular classification in older cancer patients remains insufficient. In this study, we identified two subgroups with distinct senescent clusters among geriatric breast cancer patients through multi-omics analysis. Using various machine learning algorithms, we developed a comprehensive scoring model called "Sene_Signature," which more accurately distinguished elderly breast cancer patients compared with existing methods and better predicted their prognosis. The Sene_Signature was correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration, as supported by single-cell transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, and pathological data. Furthermore, we observed increased drug responsiveness in patients with a high Sene_Signature to treatments targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor and cell-cycle pathways. We also established a user-friendly web platform to assist investigators in assessing Sene_Signature scores and predicting treatment responses for elderly breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we developed a novel model for evaluating prognosis and therapeutic responses, providing a potential molecular classification that assists in the pre-treatment assessment of geriatric breast cancer.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Liver metastasis poses a significant barrier to effective immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as a vital supplementary therapeutic approach for these patients. However, its impact on the tumor microenvironment following the ablation of liver metastases remains unclear.
METHODS: We acquired multi-omics time-series data at 1 day, 5 days, and 14 days post-cryoablation, based on tumor and peripheral blood samples from clinical patients, cell co-culture models, and a liver metastases mouse model built on the MC38 cell line in C57BL/6 J mice. This dataset included single-cell transcriptomic sequencing, bulk tissue transcriptomic sequencing, 4D-Label-Free proteomics, flow cytometry data, western blot data, and histological immunofluorescence staining of pathological specimens.
RESULTS: We found that a neutrophil-related inflammatory state persisted for at least 14 days post-cryoablation. During this period, neutrophils underwent phenotypic changes, shifting from the N1 to the N2 type. Cryoablation also caused a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neutrophils, which triggered the formation of PAD4-dependent neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), further promoting immune evasion. Moreover, animal studies demonstrated that depleting or inhibiting the CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling axis within neutrophils, or degrading NETs, could effectively restore the host's anti-tumor immune response.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical role of neutrophils and their NETs in immune escape following cryoablation. Targeting the CXCL2-CXCR2-Ca2+-PAD4 axis could enhance the therapeutic response to PD-1 antibodies, providing a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes for colorectal cancer with liver metastases.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Poor intrauterine environments increase the prevalence for chronic metabolic diseases in offspring, whereas maternal exercise is an effective measure to break this vicious intergenerational cycle. Placenta is increasingly being studied to explore its role in maternal-fetal metabolic cross-talk. The association between placental miRNA and offspring development trajectories has been established, yet the specific role and mechanism thereof in maternal exercise-induced metabolic protection remain elusive. Here, C57BL/6 female mice were subjected to either a normal control or a high-fat diet (HFD), half of the HFD-fed dams were housed with voluntary wheel running for 3 weeks before and during gestation. At embryonic day 18.5, we sacrificed parturient mice and then conducted miRNA-seq, transcriptomic, and metabolomic profiling of the placenta. Our data revealed that maternal HFD resulted in significant alterations in both miRNA and gene expressions, as well as metabolic pathways of the placenta, whereas prenatal exercise negated these perturbations. The common differentially expressed transcripts among three groups were enriched in multiple critical pathways involving energy expenditure, signal transduction, and fetal development. Through integrated analysis of multi-omics data, we speculated that maternal exercise reversed the suppression of miR-495-5p induced by HFD, thereby inhibiting miR-495-5p-targeted Snx7 and modulating kynurenic acid production. These datasets provided novel mechanistic insight into how maternal exercise positively affects the metabolic homeostasis of offspring. The discovered important miRNAs, mRNAs, and metabolites could be promising predictive and therapeutic targets for protecting offspring metabolic health.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Race and ethnicity are proxy measures of sociocultural factors that influence cognitive test performance. Our objective was to compare different regression-based cognitive normative models adjusting for demographics and different combinations of easily accessible/commonly used social determinants of health (SDoH) factors, which may help describe cognitive performance variability historically captured by ethnoracial differences.
METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses on data from Black and White participants without mild cognitive impairment/dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who attended visit 5 in 2011-2013. Participants underwent a battery of 11 cognitive tests (3 domains: memory, executive function, language). We fit 6 separate normative models for each cognitive test, all including age and education, with different combinations of race, the Wide Range of Achievement Test (education quality proxy), and area deprivation index (neighborhood deprivation) associated with current residence. We compared model fits and calculated concordances/discordances between models using z-scores derived from each normative model and a z-score &lt;-1.5 threshold for impairment.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 2,392) had a mean age of 74.4 years, 60.4% were female, and 17.1% were of self-reported Black race. The "Full" model with race alongside demographic and SDoH measures consistently outperformed other nested submodels (likelihood ratios ≥ 100) for all domains/tests except Delayed Word Recall. Models with education quality alone ("WRAT") generally outperformed models with neighborhood deprivation ("ADI") or race ("Race") alone for memory and language tests while "Race" models performed better for executive function tests. Adding neighborhood deprivation to education quality ("WRAT + ADI") did not improve models vs using "WRAT" alone. Across all domains/tests, the concordance compared with the "Full" model was lower for "Education" and "ADI" models than for other nested models. Although numbers were small, there was greater discordance among Black (range = 8.2%-23.2%) compared with White (range = 2.2%-3.4%) participants, particularly for Boston Naming Test and executive function tests.
DISCUSSION: Education quality outperformed neighborhood disadvantage as an additional/alternative SDoH measure in normative models and may be useful to collect in cognitive aging studies. While performance varied across cognitive domains and tests, routinely reported SDoH variables (education level, education quality, late-life neighborhood deprivation) did not fully account for observed ethnoracial variability; future work should evaluate SDoH across the lifespan in more ethnoracially diverse populations.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:The Human Proteome Project (HPP), the flagship initiative of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), has pursued two goals: (1) to credibly identify at least one isoform of every protein-coding gene and (2) to make proteomics an integral part of multiomics studies of human health and disease. The past year has seen major transitions for the HPP. neXtProt was retired as the official HPP knowledge base, UniProtKB became the reference proteome knowledge base, and Ensembl-GENCODE provides the reference protein target list. A function evidence FE1-5 scoring system has been developed for functional annotation of proteins, parallel to the PE1-5 UniProtKB/neXtProt scheme for evidence of protein expression. This report includes updates from neXtProt (version 2023-09) and UniProtKB release 2024_04, with protein expression detected (PE1) for 18138 of the 19411 GENCODE protein-coding genes (93%). The number of non-PE1 proteins ("missing proteins") is now 1273. The transition to GENCODE is a net reduction of 367 proteins (19,411 PE1-5 instead of 19,778 PE1-4 last year in neXtProt). We include reports from the Biology and Disease-driven HPP, the Human Protein Atlas, and the HPP Grand Challenge Project. We expect the new Functional Evidence FE1-5 scheme to energize the Grand Challenge Project for functional annotation of human proteins throughout the global proteomics community, including π-HuB in China.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Atheroprotective shear stress preserves endothelial barrier function, while atheroprone shear stress enhances endothelial permeability. Yet, the underlying mechanisms through which distinct flow patterns regulate EC integrity remain to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of Kindlin-2, a key component of focal adhesion and endothelial adherens junctions crucial for regulating endothelial cell (EC) integrity and vascular stability.
METHODS: Mouse models of atherosclerosis in EC-specific Kindlin-2 knockout mice (Kindlin-2iΔEC) were used to study the role of Kindlin-2 in atherogenesis. Pulsatile shear (12±4 dynes/cm2) or oscillatory shear (0.5±4 dynes/cm2) were applied to culture ECs. Live-cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay, and OptoDroplet assay were used to study the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of Kindlin-2. Co-immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis, proximity ligation assay, and transendothelial electrical resistance assay were used to explore the underlying mechanism of flow-regulated Kindlin-2 function.
RESULTS: We found that Kindlin-2 localization is altered under different flow patterns. Kindlin-2iΔEC mice showed heightened vascular permeability. Kindlin-2iΔEC were bred onto ApoE-/- mice to generate Kindlin-2iΔEC; ApoE-/- mice, which displayed a significant increase in atherosclerosis lesions. In vitro data showed that in ECs, Kindlin-2 underwent LLPS, a critical process for proper focal adhesion assembly, maturation, and junction formation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that oscillatory shear increased arginine methylation of Kindlin-2, catalyzed by PRMT5 (protein arginine methyltransferase 5). Functionally, arginine hypermethylation inhibits Kindlin-2 LLPS, impairing focal adhesion assembly and junction maturation. Notably, we identified R290 of Kindlin-2 as a crucial residue for LLPS and a key site for arginine methylation. Finally, pharmacologically inhibiting arginine methylation reduces EC activation and plaque formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study elucidates that mechanical force induces arginine methylation of Kindlin-2, thereby regulating vascular stability through its impact on Kindlin-2 LLPS. Targeting Kindlin-2 arginine methylation emerges as a promising hemodynamic-based strategy for treating vascular disorders and atherosclerosis.</li>
