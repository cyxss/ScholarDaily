INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: More than 50% of first cardiovascular events (CVE) occur in populations identified as at low or intermediate risk by the risk equations, so the inclusion of additional variables, such as polygenic risk scores (PRS), has been proposed to improve the predictive capacity of these equations. The aim of this study was to assess whether a PRS, independently or with clinical risk equations, is associated with the presence, severity and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis.
METHODS: 109 subjects with atherosclerosis were selected from the ILERVAS cohort (primary prevention) and matched with 109 participants without atherosclerosis of the same age, sex and SCORE2 risk level. Atherosclerosis was assessed and quantified by arterial wall vascular ultrasound in 12 territories, and PRS was estimated using the Cardio inCode Score®. The predictive capacity of the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis was estimated, as well as the association between the extent and severity of atherosclerosis with PRS and clinical risk (SCORE2).
RESULTS: PRS was similar between participants with or without atherosclerosis (P=0.525). We did not find an association between PRS and SCORE2 (r=-0.29, P=0.709), and the addition of PRS to SCORE2 did not improve the prediction of atherosclerosis [AUC (95% CI)=0.566 (0.477, 0.654), P=0.148]. The extent of atherosclerosis was related to SCORE2 (P=0.009), but not to PRS (P=0.709).
CONCLUSIONS: The Selected PRS is not associated with the presence of atherosclerosis or clinical risk, suggesting that its additional contribution to CVE risk would be mediated by mechanisms independent of the development of atherosclerosis. Additional biomarkers are needed to improve the prediction of subclinical atherosclerosis without using imaging tests as a first step in personalized assessment.</li>

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the spatio-temporal association between features of the built environment and subclinical liver disease.
DESIGN: We used data from a large community-based population, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2002, N = 5542) with linked historical residential data that characterized past exposure to alcohol outlets (bars and liquor stores), healthy foods stores, and physical activity facilities (1990-2001). We examined whether and how past residential relate to hepatic steatosis (proxied by liver attenuation measured using computed tomography, with lower attenuation indicating higher hepatic steatosis). Hepatic steatosis is the most common.
RESULTS: We found significant associations between past residential exposure to neighborhood alcohol outlets, healthy food and physical activity resources, and hepatic steatosis. The spatial scale where the association between these features of the built environment and hepatic steatosis operate lies within 3 km (∼2 miles). The average association on liver attenuation per additional bar, liquor, healthy food store, and physical activity facility within a 2-mile buffer, were: -0.06 (95% CI -0.09, -0.03), -0.02 (95% CI -0.04, -0.009), 0.05 (95% CI 0.02, 0.07), 0.02 (95% CI 0.01, 0.04), respectively, in the preceding year of the measurement of hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, the association and spatial scale remains consistent ten years prior to the measurement of hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that modifying neighborhood environments (decreasing alcohol outlets and improving access to healthy food and physical activity) may represent an effective population-wide approach to reduce liver-related morbidity.</li>

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of zedoarondiol on neovascularization of atherosclerotic (AS) plaque by exosomes experiment.
METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were fed with high-fat diet to establish AS model and treated with high- and low-dose (10, 5 mg/kg daily) of zedoarondiol, respectively. After 14 weeks, the expressions of anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS-1) and its receptor CD36 in plaques, as well as platelet activation rate and exosome-derived miR-let-7a were detected. Then, zedoarondiol was used to intervene in platelets in vitro, and miR-let-7a was detected in platelet-derived exosomes (Pexo). Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-let-7a mimics and treated with Pexo to observe the effect of miR-let-7a in Pexo on tube formation.
RESULTS: Animal experiments showed that after treating with zedoarondiol, the neovascularization density in plaques of AS mice was significantly reduced, THBS-1 and CD36 increased, the platelet activation rate was markedly reduced, and the miR-let-7a level in Pexo was reduced (P&lt;0.01). In vitro experiments, the platelet activation rate and miR-let-7a levels in Pexo were significantly reduced after zedoarondiol's intervention. Cell experiments showed that after Pexo's intervention, the tube length increased, and the transfection of miR-let-7a minics further increased the tube length of cells, while reducing the expressions of THBS-1 and CD36.
CONCLUSION: Zedoarondiol has the effect of inhibiting neovascularization within plaque in AS mice, and its mechanism may be potentially related to inhibiting platelet activation and reducing the Pexo-derived miRNA-let-7a level.</li>

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mediating role of inflammatory biomarkers in the causal effect of body composition on lipids and atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) study were used. Observational analyses were undertaken using data from 4717 children and adolescents aged 6-18 years from Chinese who underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for body composition. MR analyses were based on summary statistics from UK Biobank, deCODE2021, GLGC, FinnGen and other large consortiums. Inflammatory biomarkers included leptin, insulin, adiponectin, osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH).
RESULTS: In retrospective observational study, through osteocalcin, body composition had effects on total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). Conversely, fat mass vs. fat-free mass demonstrated opposing effects. Insulin played a role in the association of fat mass with TC and LDL (all P &lt; 0.05). Mediation MR results indicated the causal effect of fat-free mass on coronary atherosclerosis via insulin (indirect effect, OR (odds ratio): 0.95 [95%CI, 0.92-0.98]) and adiponectin (OR: 0.96 [95%CI, 0.93-0.99]). Adiponectin also mediated the causal association of fat mass with coronary heart disease (OR: 1.06 [95%CI, 1.02-1.10]) and coronary atherosclerosis (OR: 1.05 [95%CI, 1.01, 1.09]). Leptin, adiponectin and insulin played roles in mediating the casual effects of body composition on triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest different body composition exert varying influences on lipids and atherosclerosis through distinct inflammatory biomarkers. The findings may be helpful in tailoring management of body composition based on inflammatory biomarkers with different lipid profiles.</li>

Creatine is a feed additive with physiological pleiotropic properties and also an energy homeostasis protector in vertebrates and is successfully used in terrestrial livestock and aquaculture. Here, two feeding trials were performed to investigate dietary creatine on endogenous creatine metabolism and physiological reprogramming in largemouth bass. The results showed that the endogenous creatine metabolism genes AGAT, GAMT, and SLC6A8 of largemouth bass are highly conserved with the amino acid sequences of other teleosts and are clustered separately from mammals. Among the 16 major tissues in largemouth bass, both creatine synthesis genes (agat, gamt) and transporter gene slc6a8 are most highly expressed in muscle. Muscle has a high threshold but sensitive creatine negative feedback to regulate endogenous creatine metabolism. Dietary creatine intake significantly inhibits endogenous creatine synthesis and transport in muscle in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect recovers with a decrease in dietary creatine content. In addition, physiological creatine saturation required prolonged exogenous creatine intake, and it would be shortened by high doses of creatine, which provides guidance for maximizing economic benefits in aquaculture. Metabolome and transcriptome showed that dietary creatine significantly affected the metabolism of the creatine precursor substance-arginine. Exogenous creatine intake spared arginine that would otherwise be used for creatine synthesis, increased arginine levels, and caused reprogramming of arginine metabolism. Overall, these results demonstrate that the addition of creatine to largemouth bass diets is safe and recoverable, and the benefits of creatine intake in largemouth bass are not limited to enhancing the function of creatine itself but also include a reduction in the metabolic burden of essential amino acids to better growth performance.</li>

In recent years, the widespread use of bisphenol compounds and microplastics (MP) have attracted attention due to their harmful effects. Here, individual and combined effects of MP and bisphenol compounds, were assessed on adult zebrafish after co-exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) and 25 μm polyethylene MP. Impacts on their offspring (the F1 generation) were also investigated. The reproductive toxicity in adult zebrafish impacted exerted by bisphenol compounds were aggravated by the co-presence of MP. Transcriptomics and metabolomics further showed single or co-exposure of bisphenol compounds and MP could together regulate apoptosis, calcium signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid signaling pathways. Our results also showed the different toxicity mechanisms on transcriptional and metabolic profiles in the combination effects of bisphenol compounds and MP. The co-exposure of BPA and MP predominantly influenced neurotoxicity via the MAPK signaling pathway and voltage-dependent calcium channels, whereas the co-exposure of BPS and MP principally affected visual development through phototransduction and retinol metabolism. The co-exposure of BPA and MP, as well as BPS and MP, specifically regulate lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in zebrafish offspring, respectively. Overall, this study provided a deep understanding of the toxicity differences between co-exposure and single exposure of bisphenol compound and MP in zebrafish, as well as the transgenerational effects and potential molecular mechanisms of bisphenol compounds and MP in zebrafish offspring.</li>

Accurately predicting druggable genes is of paramount importance for enhancing the efficacy of targeted therapies, reducing drug-related toxicities and improving patients' survival rates. Nevertheless, accurately predicting candidate cancer-druggable genes remains a critical challenge in translational medicine due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cancer data. In this study, we proposed a novel graph neural approach called Druggable Gene Discovery based on the Integration of Multi-omics Data and the Multi-view Network (MDMNI-DGD), aiming to predict and evaluate cancer-druggable genes. MDMNI-DGD integrated a comprehensive set of multi-omics data, including copy number variations, DNA methylation, somatic mutations, and gene expression profiles. Simultaneously, it constructed the multi-view gene association network based on protein-protein interactions (PPI), protein structural domains, gene co-expression, pathway co-occurrence, gene sequence and gene ontology. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, MDMNI-DGD exhibits excellent performance in key evaluation metrics such as AUROC and AUPR. Moreover, the case study has also demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in discovering potentially druggable genes. Among more than 20,000 protein-coding genes, MDMNI-DGD successfully identified 872 potentially druggable genes. The findings from this investigation may serve to bolster the assessment of pan-cancer druggable genes, potentially catalyzing the development of more personalized and efficacious therapeutic interventions.</li>

BACKGROUND: Accumulation of coumarins plays key roles in response to immune and abiotic stress in plants, but the genetic adaptation basis of controlling coumarins in perennial woody plants remain unclear.
RESULTS: We detected 792 SNPs within 334 genes that were significantly associated with the phenotypic variations of 15 single-metabolic traits and multiple comprehensive index, such as principal components (PCs) of coumarins metabolites. Expression quantitative trait locus mapping uncovered that 337 eQTLs associated with the expression levels of 132 associated genes. Selective sweep revealed 55 candidate genes have potential selective signature among three geographical populations, highlighting that the coumarins biosynthesis have been encountered forceful local adaptation. Furthermore, we constructed a genetic network of seven candidate genes that coordinately regulate coumarins biosynthesis, revealing the multiple regulatory patterns affecting coumarins accumulation in Populus tomentosa. Validation of candidate gene variations in a drought-tolerated population and DUF538 heterologous transformation experiments verified the function of candidate genes and their roles in adapting to the different geographical conditions in poplar.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the genetic regulation of the coumarins metabolic biosynthesis of Populus, and offered potential clues for drought-tolerance evaluation and regional improvement in woody plants.</li>

Artemisia selengensis Turcz is a perennial herb belonging to the genus Artemisia in the family Asteraceae. Known for its nutrient richness, distinct flavor, and medicinal properties, Artemisia selengensis Turcz. has garnered attention. However, its efficacy, particularly in alleviating hepatic injury, remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of the 50% ethanol extract of Artemisia selengensis Turcz. (ASTE) in a mouse model of Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)-induced liver injury. Through multi-omics analysis, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and intestinal flora examination, we explored the pathways and key targets of ASTE in treating liver injury. Network pharmacology further identified the crucial components of ASTE for liver injury treatment. Our findings indicate that ASTE affects intestinal flora such as Adlercreutzia through flavonoids, particularly naringin and epicatechin. Additionally, key genes in the PPAR pathway, such as Fabp3, Fabp5, Ehhadh, and Pltp, influence glycerophospholipid metabolism, contributing to liver injury amelioration. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ASTE's hepatoprotective effects, laying the groundwork for its potential application as a functional food.</li>

We aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma proteins and metabolites and the occurrence of future strokes using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics as well as to identify other biomarkers that could predict stroke risk in hypertensive patients. In a nested case-control study, baseline plasma samples were collected from 50 hypertensive subjects who developed stroke and 50 gender-, age- and body mass index-matched controls. Plasma untargeted metabolomics and data independent acquisition-based proteomics analysis were performed in hypertensive patients, and 19 metabolites and 111 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Integrative analyses revealed that molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of protein digestion and absorption, salivary secretion, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton, along with significant metabolic suppression. C4BPA, Caprolactam, Col15A1, and HBB were identified as predictors of stroke occurrence, and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was determined to be the optimal predictive model by integrating six machine-learning classification models. The SVM model showed strong performance in both the internal validation set (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.977, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.941-1.000) and the external independent validation set (AUC: 0.973, 95% CI: 0.921-0.999).</li>

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a prevalent form of head and neck cancer, poses a significant health challenge with limited improvements in patient outcomes over the years. Its development is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic alterations and environmental factors. While progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms driving OSCC, pinpointing critical molecular markers and potential drug candidates has proven elusive. This study uniquely endeavors to conduct a meta-analysis to unveil therapeutic genes responsible for OSCC tumorigenesis. A multi-omics approach identified 951 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSCC by analyzing microarray data from the NCBI GEO database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) detected a significant hub gene module comprising 805 genes, followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction network resulting in two small clusters of 7 gene-encoded proteins each. These clusters were filtered out based on top 10 significant pathways and gene ontology terms to identify six key target proteins with elevated expression levels, acting as potential therapeutic biomarkers for OSCC. Notably, RSAD2 emerged as a novel biomarker linked to OSCC progression. Furthermore, we identified potential inhibitors targeting AURKA, AURKB, and RSAD2 proteins and validated their interactions through molecular dynamics simulation studies. The simulations confirmed the stability of receptor-ligand complexes, suggesting ZINC03839281, ZINC04026167, and ZINC00718292 compounds hold promise as potential inhibitors for therapeutically targeting AURKA, AURKB, and RSAD2 as significant OSCC biomarkers. We recommend further comprehensive studies, including experimental and preclinical investigations, to validate the effectiveness of these lead compounds for OSCC treatment.</li>

Inversions are balanced structural variants that often remain undetected in genetic diagnostics. We present a female proband with a de novo Chromosome 15 paracentric inversion, disrupting MEIS2 and NUSAP1. The inversion was detected by short-read genome sequencing and confirmed with adaptive long-read sequencing. The breakpoint junction analysis revealed a 96 bp (bp) deletion and an 18 bp insertion in the two junctions, suggesting that the rearrangement arose through a replicative error. Transcriptome sequencing of cultured fibroblasts revealed normal MEIS2 levels and 0.61-fold decreased expression of NUSAP1. Furthermore, three fusion transcripts were detected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Heterozygous loss of MEIS2 (MIM# 600987) is associated with a cleft palate, heart malformations, and intellectual impairment, which overlap with the clinical symptoms observed in the proband. The observed fusion transcripts are likely non-functional, and MEIS2 haploinsufficiency is the likely disease causative mechanism. Altogether, this study's findings illustrate the importance of including inversions in rare disease diagnostic testing and highlight the value of long read sequencing for the validation and characterization of such variants.</li>

Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in
recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This
paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both
efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model
architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then
compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to
efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a
systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its
entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or
surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide
range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training
costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by
1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and
models available to facilitate reproducibility.</li>

Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by
increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text
tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that
the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and
SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce
VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative
tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and
improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed
VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is
well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous
methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance
gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances
model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the
LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while
achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy
and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features
rather than merely increasing token length. Our code is available at

This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation
with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to
command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and
cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language
instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a
2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with
locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA,
NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form
of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a
visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves
previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are
demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more
realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models, leveraging the power of Large
Language Models, has recently demonstrated superior multimodal understanding
and reasoning abilities, heralding a new era for artificial general
intelligence. However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension
and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse
scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex
environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning
abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark
designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of
real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4
major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life.
EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing
egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a
first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in
everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth
analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges
in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current
MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal
prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by
10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds
light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides
insights for future enhancements in this critical area. We have made data and

Videos are inherently temporal sequences by their very nature. In this work,
we explore the potential of modeling videos in a chronological and scalable
manner with autoregressive (AR) language models, inspired by their success in
natural language processing. We introduce DiCoDe, a novel approach that
leverages Diffusion-Compressed Deep Tokens to generate videos with a language
model in an autoregressive manner. Unlike existing methods that employ
low-level representations with limited compression rates, DiCoDe utilizes deep
tokens with a considerable compression rate (a 1000x reduction in token count).
This significant compression is made possible by a tokenizer trained through
leveraging the prior knowledge of video diffusion models. Deep tokens enable
DiCoDe to employ vanilla AR language models for video generation, akin to
translating one visual "language" into another. By treating videos as temporal
sequences, DiCoDe fully harnesses the capabilities of language models for
autoregressive generation. DiCoDe is scalable using readily available AR
architectures, and is capable of generating videos ranging from a few seconds
to one minute using only 4 A100 GPUs for training. We evaluate DiCoDe both
quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating that it performs comparably to
existing methods in terms of quality while ensuring efficient training. To
showcase its scalability, we release a series of DiCoDe configurations with
varying parameter sizes and observe a consistent improvement in performance as
the model size increases from 100M to 3B. We believe that DiCoDe's exploration
in academia represents a promising initial step toward scalable video modeling
with AR language models, paving the way for the development of larger and more
powerful video generation models.</li>

Text-to-video generation models have shown significant progress in the recent
years. However, they still struggle with generating complex dynamic scenes
based on compositional text prompts, such as attribute binding for multiple
objects, temporal dynamics associated with different objects, and interactions
between objects. Our key motivation is that complex tasks can be decomposed
into simpler ones, each handled by a role-specialized MLLM agent. Multiple
agents can collaborate together to achieve collective intelligence for complex
goals. We propose GenMAC, an iterative, multi-agent framework that enables
compositional text-to-video generation. The collaborative workflow includes
three stages: Design, Generation, and Redesign, with an iterative loop between
the Generation and Redesign stages to progressively verify and refine the
generated videos. The Redesign stage is the most challenging stage that aims to
verify the generated videos, suggest corrections, and redesign the text
prompts, frame-wise layouts, and guidance scales for the next iteration of
generation. To avoid hallucination of a single MLLM agent, we decompose this
stage to four sequentially-executed MLLM-based agents: verification agent,
suggestion agent, correction agent, and output structuring agent. Furthermore,
to tackle diverse scenarios of compositional text-to-video generation, we
design a self-routing mechanism to adaptively select the proper correction
agent from a collection of correction agents each specialized for one scenario.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenMAC, achieving
state-of-the art performance in compositional text-to-video generation.</li>

The Human Proteome Project (HPP), the flagship initiative of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), has pursued two goals: (1) to credibly identify at least one isoform of every protein-coding gene and (2) to make proteomics an integral part of multiomics studies of human health and disease. The past year has seen major transitions for the HPP. neXtProt was retired as the official HPP knowledge base, UniProtKB became the reference proteome knowledge base, and Ensembl-GENCODE provides the reference protein target list. A function evidence FE1-5 scoring system has been developed for functional annotation of proteins, parallel to the PE1-5 UniProtKB/neXtProt scheme for evidence of protein expression. This report includes updates from neXtProt (version 2023-09) and UniProtKB release 2024_04, with protein expression detected (PE1) for 18138 of the 19411 GENCODE protein-coding genes (93%). The number of non-PE1 proteins ("missing proteins") is now 1273. The transition to GENCODE is a net reduction of 367 proteins (19,411 PE1-5 instead of 19,778 PE1-4 last year in neXtProt). We include reports from the Biology and Disease-driven HPP, the Human Protein Atlas, and the HPP Grand Challenge Project. We expect the new Functional Evidence FE1-5 scheme to energize the Grand Challenge Project for functional annotation of human proteins throughout the global proteomics community, including π-HuB in China.</li>
