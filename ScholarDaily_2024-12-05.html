We introduce Stereo Anywhere, a novel stereo-matching framework that combines
geometric constraints with robust priors from monocular depth Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs). By elegantly coupling these complementary worlds through a
dual-branch architecture, we seamlessly integrate stereo matching with learned
contextual cues. Following this design, our framework introduces novel cost
volume fusion mechanisms that effectively handle critical challenges such as
textureless regions, occlusions, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Through our novel
optical illusion dataset, MonoTrap, and extensive evaluation across multiple
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our synthetic-only trained model achieves
state-of-the-art results in zero-shot generalization, significantly
outperforming existing solutions while showing remarkable robustness to
challenging cases such as mirrors and transparencies.</li>

Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized 2D and 3D content
creation, yet generating photorealistic dynamic 4D scenes remains a significant
challenge. Existing dynamic 4D generation methods typically rely on distilling
knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, often fine-tuned on synthetic
object datasets. Consequently, the resulting scenes tend to be object-centric
and lack photorealism. While text-to-video models can generate more realistic
scenes with motion, they often struggle with spatial understanding and provide
limited control over camera viewpoints during rendering. To address these
limitations, we present PaintScene4D, a novel text-to-4D scene generation
framework that departs from conventional multi-view generative models in favor
of a streamlined architecture that harnesses video generative models trained on
diverse real-world datasets. Our method first generates a reference video using
a video generation model, and then employs a strategic camera array selection
for rendering. We apply a progressive warping and inpainting technique to
ensure both spatial and temporal consistency across multiple viewpoints.
Finally, we optimize multi-view images using a dynamic renderer, enabling
flexible camera control based on user preferences. Adopting a training-free
architecture, our PaintScene4D efficiently produces realistic 4D scenes that
can be viewed from arbitrary trajectories. The code will be made publicly
available. Our project page is at https://paintscene4d.github.io/</li>

We present Turbo3D, an ultra-fast text-to-3D system capable of generating
high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a
rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian
reconstructor, both operating in latent space. The 4-step, 4-view generator is
a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which
encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multi-view teacher and
photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian
reconstructor's inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra
image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum
efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to
previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime.</li>

Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which
is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a
volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time
constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If
achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g.,
3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In
this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding
(QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly
learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each
time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for
high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the
residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains
a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other
than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position
residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector
as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as
a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV
benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all
metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size
to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350
FPS. Project website is at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/amri/projects/queen</li>

Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by
increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text
tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that
the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and
SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce
VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative
tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and
improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed
VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is
well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous
methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance
gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances
model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the
LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while
achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy
and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features
rather than merely increasing token length. Our code is available at

The choice of data representation is a key factor in the success of deep
learning in geometric tasks. For instance, DUSt3R has recently introduced the
concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction, and
showing that one can reduce all the key problems in the 3D reconstruction of
static scenes to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an
analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of
the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual
Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the {same}
image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the
other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point
maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the
complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose
estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically
that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict;
specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained
purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while
generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin
previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of
objects.</li>

We consider indoor 3D object detection with respect to a single RGB(-D) frame
acquired from a commodity handheld device. We seek to significantly advance the
status quo with respect to both data and modeling. First, we establish that
existing datasets have significant limitations to scale, accuracy, and
diversity of objects. As a result, we introduce the Cubify-Anything 1M (CA-1M)
dataset, which exhaustively labels over 400K 3D objects on over 1K highly
accurate laser-scanned scenes with near-perfect registration to over 3.5K
handheld, egocentric captures. Next, we establish Cubify Transformer (CuTR), a
fully Transformer 3D object detection baseline which rather than operating in
3D on point or voxel-based representations, predicts 3D boxes directly from 2D
features derived from RGB(-D) inputs. While this approach lacks any 3D
inductive biases, we show that paired with CA-1M, CuTR outperforms point-based
methods - accurately recalling over 62% of objects in 3D, and is significantly
more capable at handling noise and uncertainty present in commodity
LiDAR-derived depth maps while also providing promising RGB only performance
without architecture changes. Furthermore, by pre-training on CA-1M, CuTR can
outperform point-based methods on a more diverse variant of SUN RGB-D -
supporting the notion that while inductive biases in 3D are useful at the
smaller sizes of existing datasets, they fail to scale to the data-rich regime
of CA-1M. Overall, this dataset and baseline model provide strong evidence that
we are moving towards models which can effectively Cubify Anything.</li>

We introduce a novel method for human shape and pose recovery that can fully
leverage multiple static views. We target fixed-multiview people monitoring,
including elderly care and safety monitoring, in which calibrated cameras can
be installed at the corners of a room or an open space but whose configuration
may vary depending on the environment. Our key idea is to formulate it as
neural optimization. We achieve this with HeatFormer, a neural optimizer that
iteratively refines the SMPL parameters given multiview images, which is
fundamentally agonistic to the configuration of views. HeatFormer realizes this
SMPL parameter estimation as heat map generation and alignment with a novel
transformer encoder and decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HeatFormer
including its accuracy, robustness to occlusion, and generalizability through
an extensive set of experiments. We believe HeatFormer can serve a key role in
passive human behavior modeling.</li>

Latent variable generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
generative tasks including image and video synthesis. These models are enabled
by pretrained autoencoders that map high resolution data into a compressed
lower dimensional latent space, where the generative models can subsequently be
developed while requiring fewer computational resources. Despite their
effectiveness, the direct application of latent variable models to higher
dimensional domains such as videos continues to pose challenges for efficient
training and inference. In this paper, we propose an autoencoder that projects
volumetric data onto a four-plane factorized latent space that grows
sublinearly with the input size, making it ideal for higher dimensional data
like videos. The design of our factorized model supports straightforward
adoption in a number of conditional generation tasks with latent diffusion
models (LDMs), such as class-conditional generation, frame prediction, and
video interpolation. Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space
retains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite
the heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with
significant improvements in speed and memory.</li>

Recent advances in video diffusion models have unlocked new potential for
realistic audio-driven talking video generation. However, achieving seamless
audio-lip synchronization, maintaining long-term identity consistency, and
producing natural, audio-aligned expressions in generated talking videos remain
significant challenges. To address these challenges, we propose Memory-guided
EMOtion-aware diffusion (MEMO), an end-to-end audio-driven portrait animation
approach to generate identity-consistent and expressive talking videos. Our
approach is built around two key modules: (1) a memory-guided temporal module,
which enhances long-term identity consistency and motion smoothness by
developing memory states to store information from a longer past context to
guide temporal modeling via linear attention; and (2) an emotion-aware audio
module, which replaces traditional cross attention with multi-modal attention
to enhance audio-video interaction, while detecting emotions from audio to
refine facial expressions via emotion adaptive layer norm. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MEMO generates more
realistic talking videos across diverse image and audio types, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in overall quality, audio-lip synchronization,
identity consistency, and expression-emotion alignment.</li>

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models, leveraging the power of Large
Language Models, has recently demonstrated superior multimodal understanding
and reasoning abilities, heralding a new era for artificial general
intelligence. However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension
and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse
scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex
environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning
abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark
designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of
real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4
major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life.
EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing
egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a
first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in
everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth
analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges
in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current
MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal
prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by
10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training. Our work not only sheds
light on the current limitations of MLLMs in planning, but also provides
insights for future enhancements in this critical area. We have made data and

Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in
recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This
paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both
efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model
architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then
compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to
efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a
systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its
entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or
surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide
range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training
costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by
1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and
models available to facilitate reproducibility.</li>

Large-scale diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality images from textual descriptions, gaining popularity across
various applications. However, the generation of layered content, such as
transparent images with foreground and background layers, remains an
under-explored area. Layered content generation is crucial for creative
workflows in fields like graphic design, animation, and digital art, where
layer-based approaches are fundamental for flexible editing and composition. In
this paper, we propose a novel image generation pipeline based on Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) that generates images with two layers: a foreground
layer (RGBA) with transparency information and a background layer (RGB). Unlike
existing methods that generate these layers sequentially, our approach
introduces a harmonized generation mechanism that enables dynamic interactions
between the layers for more coherent outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments,
showing significant improvements in visual coherence, image quality, and layer
consistency compared to baseline methods.</li>

This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation
with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to
command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and
cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language
instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a
2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with
locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA,
NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form
of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a
visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves
previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are
demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more
realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show
more results at https://navila-bot.github.io/</li>

Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs
impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the
overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In
this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the
Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects
essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,
integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of
training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the
MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)
and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision
tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive
ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio
layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully
unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and
performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we
conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.
Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline
models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and
77.7% GPU hours during training.</li>

The [ P S I + ]  prion phenotype in yeast manifests as a white, pink, or red color pigment. Experimental manipulations destabilize prion phenotypes, and allow colonies to exhibit [ p s i - ]  (red) sectored phenotypes within otherwise completely white colonies. Further investigation of the size and frequency of sectors that emerge as a result of experimental manipulation is capable of providing critical information on mechanisms of prion curing, but we lack a way to reliably extract this information. Images of experimental colonies exhibiting sectored phenotypes offer an abundance of data to help uncover molecular mechanisms of sectoring, yet the structure of sectored colonies is ignored in traditional biological pipelines. In this study, we present [PSI]-CIC, the first computational pipeline designed to identify and characterize features of sectored yeast colonies. To overcome the barrier of a lack of manually annotated data of colonies, we develop a neural network architecture that we train on synthetic images of colonies and apply to real images of [ P S I + ]  , [ p s i - ]  , and sectored colonies. In hand-annotated experimental images, our pipeline correctly predicts the state of approximately 95% of colonies detected and frequency of sectors in approximately 89.5% of colonies detected. The scope of our pipeline could be extended to categorizing colonies grown under different experimental conditions, allowing for more meaningful and detailed comparisons between experiments. Our approach streamlines the analysis of sectored yeast colonies providing a rich set of quantitative metrics and provides insight into mechanisms driving the curing of prion phenotypes.</li>

Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in
closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously
identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent
foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a
novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set
reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to
formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint
satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time
monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further
introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or
their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater
generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual
programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show
that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by
31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators
and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop
control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in
cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</li>

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are critical to human-computer interaction,
yet automating GUI tasks remains challenging due to the complexity and
variability of visual environments. Existing approaches often rely on textual
representations of GUIs, which introduce limitations in generalization,
efficiency, and scalability. In this paper, we introduce Aguvis, a unified pure
vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various
platforms. Our approach leverages image-based observations, and grounding
instructions in natural language to visual elements, and employs a consistent
action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. To address the
limitations of previous work, we integrate explicit planning and reasoning
within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact
with complex digital environments. We construct a large-scale dataset of GUI
agent trajectories, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding, and
employ a two-stage training pipeline that first focuses on general GUI
grounding, followed by planning and reasoning. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art
methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving, to our
knowledge, the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of
performing tasks independently without collaboration with external
closed-source models. We open-sourced all datasets, models, and training

Mechanical computing promises to integrate semiconductor-based digital logic in several applications, but it needs straightforward programmable devices for changing computing rules in situ. A methodology based on strain-governed, bistable soft shells that process digital information by interchanging their internal/external surfaces is proposed. This bistable behavior, explained via model-based design, safeguards robustness by working only once for each input pulse. Thus, these shells are leveraged to create a buffer and a NOT gate that lead to six fundamental gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR). All these functions are integrated into a unique programmable device, making mechanically integrated circuits more adaptable with rule-changeable logic operations. This design ensures continuous processes and general applicability to multiple types of signals (a pressurized fluid can replace mechanical driving signals is shown). It also empowers more complex logic functions suitable for expanded applications, such as the half and full adders is addressed.</li>

BACKGROUND: The incidence of alcohol-associated cancers is higher within Asian populations having an increased prevalence of an inactivating mutation in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a mitochondrial enzyme required for the clearance of acetaldehyde, a cytotoxic metabolite of ethanol. The role of alcohol consumption in promoting lung cancer is controversial, and little attention has been paid to the association between alcohol drinking and pulmonary ALDH2 expression.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data available in public databases to elucidate the role of ALDH2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
RESULTS: Transcriptional and proteomic data indicate a substantial pulmonary expression of ALDH2, which is functional for the metabolism of alcohol diffused from the bronchial circulation. ALDH2 expression is higher in healthy lung tissue than in LUAD and inhibits cell cycle, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. Moreover, low ALDH2 mRNA levels predict poor prognosis and low overall survival in LUAD patients. Interestingly, ALDH2 expression correlates with immune infiltration in LUAD.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the role of ALDH2 in lung tumor progression and immune infiltration might support its potential use as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for improving immunotherapeutic response.</li>

Creatine is a feed additive with physiological pleiotropic properties and also an energy homeostasis protector in vertebrates and is successfully used in terrestrial livestock and aquaculture. Here, two feeding trials were performed to investigate dietary creatine on endogenous creatine metabolism and physiological reprogramming in largemouth bass. The results showed that the endogenous creatine metabolism genes AGAT, GAMT, and SLC6A8 of largemouth bass are highly conserved with the amino acid sequences of other teleosts and are clustered separately from mammals. Among the 16 major tissues in largemouth bass, both creatine synthesis genes (agat, gamt) and transporter gene slc6a8 are most highly expressed in muscle. Muscle has a high threshold but sensitive creatine negative feedback to regulate endogenous creatine metabolism. Dietary creatine intake significantly inhibits endogenous creatine synthesis and transport in muscle in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect recovers with a decrease in dietary creatine content. In addition, physiological creatine saturation required prolonged exogenous creatine intake, and it would be shortened by high doses of creatine, which provides guidance for maximizing economic benefits in aquaculture. Metabolome and transcriptome showed that dietary creatine significantly affected the metabolism of the creatine precursor substance-arginine. Exogenous creatine intake spared arginine that would otherwise be used for creatine synthesis, increased arginine levels, and caused reprogramming of arginine metabolism. Overall, these results demonstrate that the addition of creatine to largemouth bass diets is safe and recoverable, and the benefits of creatine intake in largemouth bass are not limited to enhancing the function of creatine itself but also include a reduction in the metabolic burden of essential amino acids to better growth performance.</li>

Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are heterogeneous; thus, their roles in tumor development could vary depending on the cancer type. Here, we showed that TANs affect metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis hepatocellular carcinoma (MASH-related HCC) more than viral-associated HCC. We attributed this difference to the predominance of SiglecFhi TANs in MASH-related HCC tumors. Linoleic acid and GM-CSF, which are commonly elevated in the MASH-related HCC microenvironment, fostered the development of this c-Myc-driven TAN subset. Through TGFβ secretion, SiglecFhi TANs promoted HCC stemness, proliferation, and migration. Importantly, SiglecFhi TANs supported immune evasion by directly suppressing the antigen presentation machinery of tumor cells. SiglecFhi TAN removal increased the immunogenicity of a MASH-related HCC model and sensitized it to immunotherapy. Likewise, a high SiglecFhi TAN signature was associated with poor prognosis and immunotherapy resistance in HCC patients. Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding TAN heterogeneity in cancer to improve therapeutic development.</li>

The p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in various cellular processes. Phosphorylation serves as a canonical way to regulate p38α activation through a phosphorylation cascade. Thus, understanding the mechanism governing p38α phosphorylation is important. The present study demonstrated that p38α undergoes methylation at K165, which promote its phosphorylation in tumor cells. Inhibition of p38α methylation impairs p38α phosphorylation, repressing tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, KDM5D is a demethylase that interacts with p38α, mediating demethylation at K165 and inhibiting p38α phosphorylation. Moreover, KDM5D is expressed at low levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and high KDM5D expression is positively correlated with cancer survival. KDM5D markedly inhibits cell proliferation and migration via inactivating p38α, thereby slowing cancer progression in xenograft models. In summary, these findings highlight KDM5D as a demethylase of p38α at K165, elucidating a unique role for lysine demethylation in integrating cytoplasmic kinase-signaling cascades. The present results revealed the critical role of KDM5D in suppressing tumor progression, suggesting that KDM5D can serve as a potential drug target for combating hyperactive p38α-driven lung cancer.</li>

METHODS: Hyperpolarized 129Xe dynamic MR spectroscopy was performed on 10 anemia model rats and 10 control rats. A concise model based on hyperpolarized 129Xe MR signal oscillations was built for calculating pulmonary Hct. Blood tests and chemical shift saturation recovery were conducted on each rat to obtain Hct. Correlations of Hct obtained from different methods were analyzed using SPSS 22.0.
RESULTS: Hct measurements were strongly correlated with blood test (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.871, p &lt; 0.001) and chemical shift saturation recovery measurements (r = 0.956, p &lt; 0.001). Hct was 0.198 ± 0.054 for the anemic cohort and 0.457 ± 0.039 for the control group (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We developed an approach that provided a way to quantify changes in pulmonary Hct using oscillations of hyperpolarized 129Xe signals. This method shows promise for noninvasive pulmonary Hct assessment and disease evaluation.</li>

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of zedoarondiol on neovascularization of atherosclerotic (AS) plaque by exosomes experiment.
METHODS: ApoE-/- mice were fed with high-fat diet to establish AS model and treated with high- and low-dose (10, 5 mg/kg daily) of zedoarondiol, respectively. After 14 weeks, the expressions of anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS-1) and its receptor CD36 in plaques, as well as platelet activation rate and exosome-derived miR-let-7a were detected. Then, zedoarondiol was used to intervene in platelets in vitro, and miR-let-7a was detected in platelet-derived exosomes (Pexo). Finally, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-let-7a mimics and treated with Pexo to observe the effect of miR-let-7a in Pexo on tube formation.
RESULTS: Animal experiments showed that after treating with zedoarondiol, the neovascularization density in plaques of AS mice was significantly reduced, THBS-1 and CD36 increased, the platelet activation rate was markedly reduced, and the miR-let-7a level in Pexo was reduced (P&lt;0.01). In vitro experiments, the platelet activation rate and miR-let-7a levels in Pexo were significantly reduced after zedoarondiol's intervention. Cell experiments showed that after Pexo's intervention, the tube length increased, and the transfection of miR-let-7a minics further increased the tube length of cells, while reducing the expressions of THBS-1 and CD36.
CONCLUSION: Zedoarondiol has the effect of inhibiting neovascularization within plaque in AS mice, and its mechanism may be potentially related to inhibiting platelet activation and reducing the Pexo-derived miRNA-let-7a level.</li>

BACKGROUND: The relationship between serum aspartate/alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT) and subsequent development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in non-diabetic Asian adults has not yet been fully investigated in longitudinal studies.
METHODS: The study included all middle-aged and older non-diabetic Japanese citizens who received health check-ups in Zentsuji, Kagawa, Japan (1998-2023). AST/ALT was classified into three categories: &lt; 1.0 (reference), 1.0- &lt; 1.5, and ≥ 1.5. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The Weibull accelerated failure time model was used to examine the association between AST/ALT categories and subsequent CKD onset because the proportional hazards assumption was violated.
RESULTS: Of 6309 men and 9192 women, 2966 men and 4395 women remained in the final cohort. After a mean follow-up of 7.50 years for men and 8.34 years for women, 33.7% of men and 34.0% of women developed CKD. Women had higher AST/ALT than men. In women, a dose-response relationship was observed, with a 9% shorter survival time to CKD onset for AST/ALT ≥ 1.5 compared with AST/ALT &lt; 1.0. In contrast, men had a shorter survival time to CKD onset by point estimates, but the 95% confidence intervals crossed 1 in all models.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study comparing the risks of CKD development in non-diabetic men and women by AST/ALT levels, a dose-response relationship was only observed in women. Differences in the distribution of AST/ALT by sex may have affected the results. Therefore, in non-diabetic Japanese women, AST/ALT may be used as an indicator of future CKD development.</li>

Diabetic periodontitis (DP) stems from hyperglycemia-driven oxidative stress amplification and chronic inflammation, leading to periodontal tissue breakdown. Misregulated forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) play key roles in this process, exacerbating both inflammation and oxidative stress. In light of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)'s potent anti-oxidative capacity and anti-inflammatory potential, understanding how it modulates these central pathways to alleviate DP holds high scientific and clinical importance. An animal model of diabetic mice periodontitis was established, and the model mice were injected with FOXM 1 adenovirus to enrich FOXM 1, and the periodontal pathological histology of each group was evaluated by HE staining. Western blotting and RT-PCR evaluated the expression levels of factors involved in bone destruction. ELISA evaluated the amount of inflammatory factors in mice serum. FOXM 1 over-expression and NAC were treated in murine macrophages, and the intracellular reactive oxygen species(ROS) levels in macrophages were measured using a DCFH-DA probe. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to establish the macrophage osteoclast differentiation model and test the expression level of osteoclast differentiation factors after giving NAC. Hydrogen peroxide was used to establish a peroxidation environment, the plasmid silenced C-JUN, and the DNA binding activity of activating protein-1(AP1) was detected by EMSA. The effect of peroxidation on the osteoclast differentiation level was determined by WB. Mice with DP model had epithelial damage and inflammatory infiltration in periodontal tissues, and in the FOXM1 enriched group, the periodontal epithelial damage was repaired and inflammation was alleviated. FOXM1 enrichment resulted in DP model lower expression of RANKL (P &lt; 0.01), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (P &lt; 0.01) and elevated expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) (P &lt; 0.001). Serum levels of pro-inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were elevated in DP mice (P &lt; 0.001), and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was reduced(P &lt; 0.001),, and FOXM1 enrichment significantly reversed inflammatory factor levels (P &lt; 0.01). Overexpression of FOXM1 reduced ROS content in macrophages (P &lt; 0.001), and NAC was performed to further reduce ROS content (P &lt; 0.01). Silencing of FOXM1 elevated the expression of osteoclast-specific genes NFATc1, TRAP and OSCAR (P &lt; 0.01), and the addition of NAC on top of silencing of FOXM1 markedly suppressed the expression level of osteoclast-specific genes (P &lt; 0.01). ROS increased the transcriptional activity of AP1 (P &lt; 0.001), which promoted osteoclast-specific gene expression (P &lt; 0.001), and osteoclast-specific gene expression was decreased after silencing C-JUN (P &lt; 0.01). FOXM1 relieve diabetic periodontitis inflammation and promote bone formation, regulates ROS production and ROS increases the transcriptional activity of AP1 and affects the osteoclastic differentiation of macrophages, which plays a positive role in bone protection in diabetic periodontitis.</li>

Artemisia selengensis Turcz is a perennial herb belonging to the genus Artemisia in the family Asteraceae. Known for its nutrient richness, distinct flavor, and medicinal properties, Artemisia selengensis Turcz. has garnered attention. However, its efficacy, particularly in alleviating hepatic injury, remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of the 50% ethanol extract of Artemisia selengensis Turcz. (ASTE) in a mouse model of Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)-induced liver injury. Through multi-omics analysis, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and intestinal flora examination, we explored the pathways and key targets of ASTE in treating liver injury. Network pharmacology further identified the crucial components of ASTE for liver injury treatment. Our findings indicate that ASTE affects intestinal flora such as Adlercreutzia through flavonoids, particularly naringin and epicatechin. Additionally, key genes in the PPAR pathway, such as Fabp3, Fabp5, Ehhadh, and Pltp, influence glycerophospholipid metabolism, contributing to liver injury amelioration. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ASTE's hepatoprotective effects, laying the groundwork for its potential application as a functional food.</li>

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) poses one of the major challenges in clinical anti-infective therapy worldwide. This retrospective cohort study at a tertiary general hospital in Wuhan aimed to identify risk factors for hospital-acquired CRKP infections among 1,113 patients. All participants were aged 18 years and above, and had confirmed positive cultures for KP isolated within 48 hours post-hospitalization. Independent risk factors were identified using LASSO logistic regression and incorporated into a predictive nomogram. The factors included in the nomogram were prior carbapenem exposure, prior β-lactams-β-lactamase inhibitor combination (BLBLI) exposure, prior intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and prior mechanical ventilation. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the nomogram were 0.793 in the training group (70% of patients) and 0.788 in the validation group (30% of patients), demonstrating its discriminatory power and predictive accuracy. The P values for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were 0.333 and 0.684, indicating good calibration. The clinical utility of the nomogram was further supported by decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC), demonstrating its potential to guide clinical decision-making. Our retrospective analysis identified key risk factors for CRKP infection and developed a nomogram that could effectively predict CRKP infections in hospitalized patients. Although the single-center nature of this study limits generalizability, the nomogram provides a foundation for future prospective, multicenter validations.IMPORTANCEWe established a nomogram scoring system that incorporates four key risk factors: prior carbapenem exposure, prior β-lactams-β-lactamase inhibitor combination (BLBLI) exposure, prior intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and prior mechanical ventilation. This nomogram demonstrated strong discriminatory power, excellent calibration, and significant clinical utility. This study highlights the critical risk factors associated with hospital-acquired carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections, providing valuable insights for clinicians to identify high-risk patients.</li>

Microplastics (MPs), degraded from plastic wastes, have drawn significant attention worldwide due to its prevalence and rapid transition. Contamination of freshwater with MPs has become an emerging global issue. Heavy metals (HMs), a prominent global pollutant, also garnered much attention due to their potential interaction with MPs, presenting a multifaceted environmental threat. The primary source of HM contamination in freshwater has been identified as mining sites. Additionally, the increasing use of plastic materials within mining areas raises concerns about MP release into the surrounding freshwater environments. Recent studies only provide information on the contamination of HMs status with MPs. However, studies on the mechanism responsible for MPs contamination from both external and internal sources of freshwater MPs and HMs are limited. The knowledge gaps in the deposition and fate of MPs in various mining situations and the possibility of combined impacts of heavy metals and MPs in the ecosystem raise ecological concerns. Here, we review the origins of MPs and HM pollution within mining sites and explore the potential combined detrimental impacts on plants and animal life. We found out that polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) have higher adsorption affinity to heavy metals, and the mingle toxic consequence of the MPs and HM can depend on the MP surface properties, pH, and salinity of the neighboring water solution. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models enable the efficient design of adsorption systems. The Langmuir model describes single-layer adsorption at homogeneous sites, while the Freundlich model addresses multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The crucial mechanism of adsorption and desorption that underlies the occurrence of both MPs and heavy metals is a decisive matter in this issue.</li>

We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a
two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems
where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that
interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave
theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this
to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial
relaxation. We also characterize dependence of liquid and vapor densities on
the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside
the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system,
displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian
density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but
this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium
case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an
effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave
fluctuations.</li>

<li><strong>Authors</strong>:Takaki R, Thirumalai D
Understanding the biophysical basis of protein aggregation is important in biology because of the potential link to several misfolding diseases. Although experiments have shown that protein aggregates adopt a variety of morphologies, the dynamics of their formation are less well characterized. Here, we introduce a minimal model to explore the dependence of the aggregation dynamics on the structural and sequence features of the monomers. Using simulations, we demonstrate that sequence complexity (codified in terms of word entropy) and monomer rigidity profoundly influence the dynamics and morphology of the aggregates. Flexible monomers with low sequence complexity (corresponding to repeat sequences) form liquid-like droplets that exhibit ergodic behavior. Strikingly, these aggregates abruptly transition to more ordered structures, reminiscent of amyloid fibrils, when the monomer rigidity is increased. In contrast, aggregates resulting from monomers with high sequence complexity are amorphous and display nonergodic glassy dynamics. The heterogeneous dynamics of the low and high-complexity sequences follow stretched exponential kinetics, which is one of the characteristics of glassy dynamics. Importantly, at nonzero values of the bending rigidities, the aggregates age with the relaxation times that increase with the waiting time. Informed by these findings, we provide insights into aging dynamics in protein condensates and contrast the behavior with the dynamics expected in RNA repeat sequences. Our findings underscore the influence of the monomer characteristics in shaping the morphology and dynamics of protein aggregates, thus providing a foundation for deciphering the general rules governing the behavior of protein condensates.</li>

Many microorganisms exhibit upstream swimming, which is important to many biological processes and can cause contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotactic behavior of Escherichia coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning (ST) polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotactic data in both Newtonian and ST fluids.</li>

Mechanical computing promises to integrate semiconductor-based digital logic in several applications, but it needs straightforward programmable devices for changing computing rules in situ. A methodology based on strain-governed, bistable soft shells that process digital information by interchanging their internal/external surfaces is proposed. This bistable behavior, explained via model-based design, safeguards robustness by working only once for each input pulse. Thus, these shells are leveraged to create a buffer and a NOT gate that lead to six fundamental gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR). All these functions are integrated into a unique programmable device, making mechanically integrated circuits more adaptable with rule-changeable logic operations. This design ensures continuous processes and general applicability to multiple types of signals (a pressurized fluid can replace mechanical driving signals is shown). It also empowers more complex logic functions suitable for expanded applications, such as the half and full adders is addressed.</li>

Maternal obesity has deleterious effects on the process of establishing oocyte DNA methylation; yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that maternal obesity disrupted the genomic methylation of oocytes using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse model, at least a part of which was transmitted to the F2 oocytes and livers via females. We further examined the metabolome of serum and found that the serum concentration of melatonin was reduced. Exogenous melatonin treatment significantly reduced the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes, and the increased expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in HFD oocytes was also decreased. These suggest that melatonin may play a key role in the disrupted genomic methylation in the oocytes of obese mice. To address how melatonin regulates the expression of DNMTs, the function of melatonin was inhibited or activated upon oocytes. Results revealed that melatonin may regulate the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. These results suggest that maternal obesity induces genomic methylation alterations in oocytes, which can be partly transmitted to F2 in females, and that melatonin is involved in regulating the hyper-methylation of HFD oocytes by increasing the expression of DNMTs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway.</li>

Vascular stent intervention is a pivotal treatment for coronary atherosclerosis, though in-stent thrombosis remains a significant postoperative complication with an unclear underlying mechanism. This study utilized dissipated particle dynamics analysis to investigate the impact of stent and its injury on platelet behavior. The findings suggest that thrombus formation upstream of the stent is mainly initiated by upstream arterial injury, which leads to increased platelet accumulation and activation in that area. While thrombosis downstream of the stent is more directly influenced by the stent itself. The morphology and size of in-stent thrombosis can vary significantly due to the different contributions of the stent and underlying injuries. Additionally, the volume of in-stent thrombosis is affected by the extent of the injury and the viscosity of platelets, showing a notable increase in volume with the lengthening of the injury area and rise in platelet viscosity. This study provides a novel theoretical framework for optimizing stent placement strategies and structural designs by examining the effects of stent struts and associated injuries on thrombus formation.</li>

Previous research has shown that parental psychological aggression may change with children's age, and individual differences existed in the developmental trajectories of parental psychological aggression within different families. However, most studies on the heterogeneous psychological aggression trajectories have focused solely on mothers or combined mothers' and fathers' data, with few studies separately exploring the unique trajectories of fathers and mothers and their predictors and outcomes within Chinese societies. Therefore, this study investigated the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from middle childhood to early adolescence and their associations with child- and family-level predictors and outcomes in China. A total of 1137 Chinese families with children in grades 1-3 (M<sub>age</sub> = 7.17; SD<sub>age</sub> = 0.95 at Time 1; 52.35% boys, 47.65% girls) participated in assessments at five time points, using 1-year internals in between. Latent class growth models were used to estimate the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from ages 7 to 11 years. Logistic regression analyses were used to understand the child- and family-level predictors of these trajectories, and analysis of covariance was used to examine the outcomes of these trajectories. The findings revealed that three trajectories of paternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (88.95%), high-decreasing (7.93%), and high-increasing-decreasing (3.12%) trajectories. Four trajectories of maternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (86.17%), high-decreasing (5.94%), high-increasing-decreasing (4.08%), and low-increasing (3.81%) trajectories. Lower marital satisfaction, more psychological aggression experiences during childhood, and being a parent of a boy were risk factors for both paternal and maternal trajectories, while higher negative affectivity in children was a risk factor of maternal but not paternal trajectories. In addition, the high-increasing-decreasing trajectory for both fathers and mothers as well as the low-increasing trajectory for mothers predicted children's more internalizing and externalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in understanding the developmental patterns of parental psychological aggression, their predictors, and cumulative effects on child development.</li>
