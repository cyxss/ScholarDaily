Lazy burning is a recently introduced variation of burning where only one set
of vertices is chosen to burn in the first round. In hypergraphs, lazy burning
spreads when all but one vertex in a hyperedge is burned. The lazy burning
number is the minimum number of initially burned vertices that eventually burns
all vertices. We give several equivalent characterizations of lazy burning on
hypergraphs using matchings and zero forcing, and then apply these to give new
bounds and complexity results.
  We prove that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph $H$ equals its order
minus the maximum cardinality of a certain matching on its incidence graph.
Using this characterization, we give a formula for the lazy burning number of a
dual hypergraph and give new bounds on the lazy burning number based on various
hypergraph parameters. We show that the lazy burning number of a hypergraph may
be characterized by a maximal subhypergraph that results from iteratively
deleting vertices in singleton hyperedges.
  We prove that lazy burning on a hypergraph is equivalent to zero forcing on
its incidence graph and show an equivalence between skew zero forcing on a
graph and lazy burning on its neighborhood hypergraph. As a result, we show
that finding an upper bound on the lazy burning number of a hypergraph is
NP-complete, which resolves a conjecture from \cite{BJR}. By applying lazy
burning, we show that computing an upper bound on the skew zero forcing number
for bipartite graphs is NP-complete. We finish with open problems.</li>

We prove that fractional Helly and $(p,q)$-theorems imply
$(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems in an entirely abstract setting. We give a plethora of
applications, including reproving almost all earlier $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorems
about geometric hypergraphs that were proved recently. Some of the corollaries
are new results, for example, we prove that if $\mathcal{F}$ is an infinite
family of convex compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and among every $\aleph_0$ of
the sets some $d+1$ contain a point in their intersection with integer
coordinates, then all the members of $\mathcal{F}$ can be hit with finitely
many points with integer coordinates.</li>

Quantum low-density parity-check codes are promising candidates for quantum
error correcting codes as they might offer more resource-efficient alternatives
to surface code architectures. In particular, bivariate bicycle codes have
recently gained attention due to their 2D-local structure, high encoding rate,
and promising performance under simulation. In this work, we will explore how
one can transform bivariate bicycle codes defined on lattices with periodic
boundary conditions to codes with the same locality properties on a 2D lattice
with open boundary conditions. For this, we introduce the concept of pruning
quantum codes. We explain how pruning bivariate bicycle codes is always
possible when the codes are hypergraph products of two classical cyclic codes.
We also indicate that this might be possible for more general bivariate bicycle
codes by constructing explicit examples. Finally, we investigate fault-tolerant
quantum computation using the constructed pruned codes by describing
fold-transversal gates.</li>

The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify
companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to
constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the
significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110
and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast
camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam
instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were
conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from
the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE)
values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the
anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28
astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16
Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the
separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the
companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup.
For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation,
though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star.
Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the
PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar
candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal,
considering a younger age for the system.</li>

<li><strong>Authors</strong>:Zuo Zuo, Jiahao Dong, Yue Gao, Zongze Wu
In the manufacturing industry, defect detection is an essential but
challenging task aiming to detect defects generated in the process of
production. Though traditional YOLO models presents a good performance in
defect detection, they still have limitations in capturing high-order feature
interrelationships, which hurdles defect detection in the complex scenarios and
across the scales. To this end, we introduce hypergraph computation into YOLO
framework, dubbed HyperDefect-YOLO (HD-YOLO), to improve representative ability
and semantic exploitation. HD-YOLO consists of Defect Aware Module (DAM) and
Mixed Graph Network (MGNet) in the backbone, which specialize for perception
and extraction of defect features. To effectively aggregate multi-scale
features, we propose HyperGraph Aggregation Network (HGANet) which combines
hypergraph and attention mechanism to aggregate multi-scale features.
Cross-Scale Fusion (CSF) is proposed to adaptively fuse and handle features
instead of simple concatenation and convolution. Finally, we propose Semantic
Aware Module (SAM) in the neck to enhance semantic exploitation for accurately
localizing defects with different sizes in the disturbed background. HD-YOLO
undergoes rigorous evaluation on public HRIPCB and NEU-DET datasets with
significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate
HD-YOLO on self-built MINILED dataset collected in real industrial scenarios to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The source codes are at

BACKGROUND: The incidence of alcohol-associated cancers is higher within Asian populations having an increased prevalence of an inactivating mutation in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a mitochondrial enzyme required for the clearance of acetaldehyde, a cytotoxic metabolite of ethanol. The role of alcohol consumption in promoting lung cancer is controversial, and little attention has been paid to the association between alcohol drinking and pulmonary ALDH2 expression.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data available in public databases to elucidate the role of ALDH2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
RESULTS: Transcriptional and proteomic data indicate a substantial pulmonary expression of ALDH2, which is functional for the metabolism of alcohol diffused from the bronchial circulation. ALDH2 expression is higher in healthy lung tissue than in LUAD and inhibits cell cycle, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. Moreover, low ALDH2 mRNA levels predict poor prognosis and low overall survival in LUAD patients. Interestingly, ALDH2 expression correlates with immune infiltration in LUAD.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the role of ALDH2 in lung tumor progression and immune infiltration might support its potential use as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for improving immunotherapeutic response.</li>

GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 (GATAD1) is an as-yet uncharacterized zinc finger domain protein, which was initially identified as a histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) interactor. A recessive mutation in GATAD1 is associated with adult-onset dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, suggesting that GATAD1 is critical for maintaining normal cardiac structure and function. However, little is known as to the specific role of GATAD1 in cardiomyocytes. A mammalian Gatad1 knockout model has yet to be generated for investigating its specific role in the heart. To address this, we generated a Gatad1 cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (cKO) mouse model. Gatad1 cKO mutants exhibited normal cardiac function during the aging process up to 18 months of age. Unlike the abnormal nuclei shape observed in patients carrying GATAD1 mutations, the nuclei shape of cardiomyocytes remained unaffected by the loss of Gatad1. Furthermore, Gatad1 cKO mice responded normally to pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. Together, these observations suggest that deletion of Gatad1 in cardiomyocytes does not induce cardiomyopathy during aging or affect the response to pressure overload stress in mice.</li>

The effects of aging on the satellite cell pool have primarily been studied in male mice, where the role of cell-intrinsic versus environmental changes on satellite cell function remains contentious. Estradiol is necessary for maintenance of satellite cell pool size in adult female mice-here we investigate the hypothesis that in females, estradiol is a major environmental driver of age-associated effects on satellite cells. In 24-26 month-old ovarian senescent mice, we find the satellite cell pool size is severely diminished in certain muscles (TA and EDL) but only marginally affected in others (soleus and gastrocnemius). Supplementation with 17-beta estradiol significantly increases satellite cell pool size in the TA and EDL. To assess cell-intrinsic versus environmental regulation, we perform two transplantation experiments, Adult or Aged satellite cells transplanted into Adult recipients, and Adult satellite cells transplanted into Adult or Aged mice. These results demonstrate that the aged environment dominates over cell-autonomous age in terms of the specification of satellite cell pool size. Transcriptional profiling on satellite cells from Adult, Aged and ovariectomized mice revealed commonalities across the two estradiol-deficient conditions, Aged and ovariectomized, in GO terms from differentially expressed genes. Our findings support the hypothesis that the lack of estradiol contributes to reductions in satellite cell number in Aged female muscle, yet cells that remain are functional in terms of proliferative potential and self-renewal capacity. These findings have implications for sex hormone treatment of menopausal women and highlight the vital role of estradiol in the maintenance of the satellite cell pool.</li>

Creatine is a feed additive with physiological pleiotropic properties and also an energy homeostasis protector in vertebrates and is successfully used in terrestrial livestock and aquaculture. Here, two feeding trials were performed to investigate dietary creatine on endogenous creatine metabolism and physiological reprogramming in largemouth bass. The results showed that the endogenous creatine metabolism genes AGAT, GAMT, and SLC6A8 of largemouth bass are highly conserved with the amino acid sequences of other teleosts and are clustered separately from mammals. Among the 16 major tissues in largemouth bass, both creatine synthesis genes (agat, gamt) and transporter gene slc6a8 are most highly expressed in muscle. Muscle has a high threshold but sensitive creatine negative feedback to regulate endogenous creatine metabolism. Dietary creatine intake significantly inhibits endogenous creatine synthesis and transport in muscle in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibitory effect recovers with a decrease in dietary creatine content. In addition, physiological creatine saturation required prolonged exogenous creatine intake, and it would be shortened by high doses of creatine, which provides guidance for maximizing economic benefits in aquaculture. Metabolome and transcriptome showed that dietary creatine significantly affected the metabolism of the creatine precursor substance-arginine. Exogenous creatine intake spared arginine that would otherwise be used for creatine synthesis, increased arginine levels, and caused reprogramming of arginine metabolism. Overall, these results demonstrate that the addition of creatine to largemouth bass diets is safe and recoverable, and the benefits of creatine intake in largemouth bass are not limited to enhancing the function of creatine itself but also include a reduction in the metabolic burden of essential amino acids to better growth performance.</li>

INTRODUCTION: We evaluated whether higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores were associated with increased incidence of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia over 22.3 years of follow-up in the community-based Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.
METHODS: One thousand four hundred eighty-seven participants (mean ± standard deviation, age in years 69 ± 6) completed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and had incident all-cause dementia and AD surveillance data available.
RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six participants developed all-cause dementia (including AD, n = 187) over a median follow-up time of 13.1 years. Higher DII scores, averaged across a maximum of three timepoints, were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.33, P &lt; 0.001; HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.34d, P = 0.001, respectively).
DISCUSSION: Higher DII scores were associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Although these promising findings need to be replicated and further validated, our results suggest that diets that correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia.
HIGHLIGHTS: Higher Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia. Higher DII scores were associated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Diets that correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia.</li>

Artemisia selengensis Turcz is a perennial herb belonging to the genus Artemisia in the family Asteraceae. Known for its nutrient richness, distinct flavor, and medicinal properties, Artemisia selengensis Turcz. has garnered attention. However, its efficacy, particularly in alleviating hepatic injury, remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of the 50% ethanol extract of Artemisia selengensis Turcz. (ASTE) in a mouse model of Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)-induced liver injury. Through multi-omics analysis, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and intestinal flora examination, we explored the pathways and key targets of ASTE in treating liver injury. Network pharmacology further identified the crucial components of ASTE for liver injury treatment. Our findings indicate that ASTE affects intestinal flora such as Adlercreutzia through flavonoids, particularly naringin and epicatechin. Additionally, key genes in the PPAR pathway, such as Fabp3, Fabp5, Ehhadh, and Pltp, influence glycerophospholipid metabolism, contributing to liver injury amelioration. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ASTE's hepatoprotective effects, laying the groundwork for its potential application as a functional food.</li>

Oxidative stress can be alleviated by antioxidants intakes. Taraxerol acetate (TA), a natural triterpenoid extracted from dandelions, may reduce the risk of metabolic disorders by regulating oxidative stress. In the study, we investigated the effects of TA in relieving oxidative stress in murine intestinal epithelial cells using multiomics techniques. Here, we found that TA activated the antioxidant defense system. Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and Catalase (CAT) activity notably increased after TA treatment. Additionally, TA treatment effectively reduced the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malonaldehyde (MDA) and alleviated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, TA induced significant changes in the levels of 30 important metabolites. Specifically, it activated the complement and coagulation cascades, NF-κB and MAPK and glycerophospholipid pathways, resulting in altered transcript levels of related genes, such as Serpinb9e, SCD2, Hspa1b, and Hspa1a. Thus, the results demonstrated that TA potentially could promote health by alleviating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage and provide valuable insights for its further development.</li>

Domoic acid is a neurotoxin secreted by the marine diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia during toxic algal bloom events. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are exposed to domoic acid through the ingestion of fish that feed on toxic diatoms, resulting in domoic acid toxicosis (DAT), which can vary from mild to fatal. Sea lions with mild disease can be treated if toxicosis is detected early after exposure. Therefore, rapid diagnosis of DAT is essential but also challenging. In this work, we performed multiomics analyses, specifically proteomic and lipidomic, on blood samples from 31 California sea lions. Fourteen sea lions were diagnosed with DAT based on clinical signs and post-mortem histological examination of brain tissue, and 17 had no evidence of DAT. Proteomic analyses revealed 31 statistically significant proteins in the DAT individuals compared to the non-DAT individuals (adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Of these proteins, 19 were decreased in the DAT group of which three were apolipoproteins that are known to transport lipids in the blood, prompting lipidomic analyses. In the lipidomic analyses, 331 lipid species were detected with high confidence and multidimensional separations, and 29 were found to be statistically significant (adjusted p &lt; 0.05 and log2(FC) &lt; -1 or &gt;1) in the DAT versus non-DAT comparison. Of these, 28 were lower in the DAT individuals, while only 1 was higher. Furthermore, 15 of the 28 lower concentration lipids were triglycerides, illustrating their putative connection with the perturbed apolipoproteins and potential use in rapid DAT diagnoses.</li>

The Human Proteome Project (HPP), the flagship initiative of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), has pursued two goals: (1) to credibly identify at least one isoform of every protein-coding gene and (2) to make proteomics an integral part of multiomics studies of human health and disease. The past year has seen major transitions for the HPP. neXtProt was retired as the official HPP knowledge base, UniProtKB became the reference proteome knowledge base, and Ensembl-GENCODE provides the reference protein target list. A function evidence FE1-5 scoring system has been developed for functional annotation of proteins, parallel to the PE1-5 UniProtKB/neXtProt scheme for evidence of protein expression. This report includes updates from neXtProt (version 2023-09) and UniProtKB release 2024_04, with protein expression detected (PE1) for 18138 of the 19411 GENCODE protein-coding genes (93%). The number of non-PE1 proteins ("missing proteins") is now 1273. The transition to GENCODE is a net reduction of 367 proteins (19,411 PE1-5 instead of 19,778 PE1-4 last year in neXtProt). We include reports from the Biology and Disease-driven HPP, the Human Protein Atlas, and the HPP Grand Challenge Project. We expect the new Functional Evidence FE1-5 scheme to energize the Grand Challenge Project for functional annotation of human proteins throughout the global proteomics community, including π-HuB in China.</li>

We aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma proteins and metabolites and the occurrence of future strokes using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics as well as to identify other biomarkers that could predict stroke risk in hypertensive patients. In a nested case-control study, baseline plasma samples were collected from 50 hypertensive subjects who developed stroke and 50 gender-, age- and body mass index-matched controls. Plasma untargeted metabolomics and data independent acquisition-based proteomics analysis were performed in hypertensive patients, and 19 metabolites and 111 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. Integrative analyses revealed that molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of protein digestion and absorption, salivary secretion, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton, along with significant metabolic suppression. C4BPA, Caprolactam, Col15A1, and HBB were identified as predictors of stroke occurrence, and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was determined to be the optimal predictive model by integrating six machine-learning classification models. The SVM model showed strong performance in both the internal validation set (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.977, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.941-1.000) and the external independent validation set (AUC: 0.973, 95% CI: 0.921-0.999).</li>

BACKGROUND: A blood-based biomarker that accurately reflects neuronal injury in acute ischemic stroke could be an easily accessible and cost-effective complement to clinical and radiological evaluation. Here, we investigate whether plasma levels of the novel biomarker brain-derived tau (BD-tau) reflect cerebral infarct volumes and whether BD-tau can improve clinical outcome prediction.
METHODS: The present study included 713 consecutive cases from two different hospital-based cohorts, the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) and SAHLSIS phase 2 (SAHLSIS2). Acute stroke severity was determined by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale converted to the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) in SAHLSIS and by the NIHSS in SAHLSIS2. All participants were assessed for functional outcome 3 months after stroke by the modified Rankin Scale, and 254 participants in SAHLSIS had quantitative neuroimaging available.
FINDINGS: Plasma BD-tau concentrations and cerebral infarct volumes were highly correlated (ρ 0.72, p &lt; 0.001). BD-tau improved the prognostic accuracy of suffering an unfavorable outcome over age and stroke severity in the whole cohort. However, the gain in predictive power was dependent on stroke severity and infarct location. The largest improvement was observed for mild ischemic strokes (NIHSS &lt;5; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73 for age + NIHSS versus AUC = 0.84 with addition of BD-tau; DeLong p 0.02), posterior circulation stroke (AUC = 0.75 vs. AUC = 0.84; DeLong p 0.06) and more specifically for infarcts in the brainstem/cerebellum (AUC = 0.74 vs. 0.87; DeLong p 0.009).

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a prevalent form of head and neck cancer, poses a significant health challenge with limited improvements in patient outcomes over the years. Its development is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic alterations and environmental factors. While progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms driving OSCC, pinpointing critical molecular markers and potential drug candidates has proven elusive. This study uniquely endeavors to conduct a meta-analysis to unveil therapeutic genes responsible for OSCC tumorigenesis. A multi-omics approach identified 951 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSCC by analyzing microarray data from the NCBI GEO database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) detected a significant hub gene module comprising 805 genes, followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction network resulting in two small clusters of 7 gene-encoded proteins each. These clusters were filtered out based on top 10 significant pathways and gene ontology terms to identify six key target proteins with elevated expression levels, acting as potential therapeutic biomarkers for OSCC. Notably, RSAD2 emerged as a novel biomarker linked to OSCC progression. Furthermore, we identified potential inhibitors targeting AURKA, AURKB, and RSAD2 proteins and validated their interactions through molecular dynamics simulation studies. The simulations confirmed the stability of receptor-ligand complexes, suggesting ZINC03839281, ZINC04026167, and ZINC00718292 compounds hold promise as potential inhibitors for therapeutically targeting AURKA, AURKB, and RSAD2 as significant OSCC biomarkers. We recommend further comprehensive studies, including experimental and preclinical investigations, to validate the effectiveness of these lead compounds for OSCC treatment.</li>

Inversions are balanced structural variants that often remain undetected in genetic diagnostics. We present a female proband with a de novo Chromosome 15 paracentric inversion, disrupting MEIS2 and NUSAP1. The inversion was detected by short-read genome sequencing and confirmed with adaptive long-read sequencing. The breakpoint junction analysis revealed a 96 bp (bp) deletion and an 18 bp insertion in the two junctions, suggesting that the rearrangement arose through a replicative error. Transcriptome sequencing of cultured fibroblasts revealed normal MEIS2 levels and 0.61-fold decreased expression of NUSAP1. Furthermore, three fusion transcripts were detected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Heterozygous loss of MEIS2 (MIM# 600987) is associated with a cleft palate, heart malformations, and intellectual impairment, which overlap with the clinical symptoms observed in the proband. The observed fusion transcripts are likely non-functional, and MEIS2 haploinsufficiency is the likely disease causative mechanism. Altogether, this study's findings illustrate the importance of including inversions in rare disease diagnostic testing and highlight the value of long read sequencing for the validation and characterization of such variants.</li>

Hypertension-induced myocardial remodelling encompasses both structural and functional changes in cardiac muscle tissue, such as myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. These alterations not only impair the systolic and diastolic functions of the heart but also elevate the risk of cardiovascular events and heart failure. One of the primary contributors to hypertensive cardiomyopathy (HTN-CM) is the over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which subsequently induces myocardial remodeling. Although conventional therapeutic strategies aim to suppress RAAS and slow the progression of heart failure, the primary challenge in treating HTN-CM remains the lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection of myocardial remodelling. Combined multi-omics analyses, complemented by experimental validation, offer a systematic understanding of the landscape of gene/protein/metabolite expression in HTN-CM, revealing the underlying mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced myocardial remodeling in HTN-CM. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are implicated in sphingolipid metabolic processes and are associated with collagen synthesis and inflammatory responses, collectively contributing to myocardial remodeling in HTN-CM. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) are also involved in inflammatory and fibrotic processes, with associations to sphingolipid signaling pathways, particularly manifested through elevated expression of IL6, COL4A1, FGG, FGB, CREBBP and SPHK2 proteins. Metabolomic profiling further elucidated the increased expression of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites S1P and Sa1P in the myocardium of HTN-CM. Integrative multi-omics analysis revealed that HTN-CM is primarily influenced by the sphingolipid signaling pathway, with additional associations to the HIF-1α and FoxO signaling pathways. Correlation analysis has highlighted strong associations between sphingolipids and genes/proteins related to fibrosis and inflammation, as well as their connection to the HIF-1α and FoxO signalling pathways. Furthermore, certain key indicators were validated through ELISA and Western blot analyses in both plasma and myocardial tissue. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that excessive Ang II may induce abnormalities in sphingolipid metabolism, resulting in increased levels of S1P in both circulating and myocardial tissues. This elevation in S1P is implicated in myocardial inflammatory and fibrotic alterations, highlighting its pivotal role in myocardial remodeling. The specific mechanism underlying the sphingolipid signaling pathway in myocardial remodeling may involve downstream biological processes, including oxidative stress and excessive mitochondrial autophagy, mediated by HIF-1α and FoxO.</li>

Recurrent ovarian cancer patients, especially those resistant to platinum, lack effective curative treatments. To address this, we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02853318) combining pembrolizumab with bevacizumab, to increase T cell infiltration into the tumor, and oral cyclophosphamide, to reduce the number of regulatory T cells. The trial accrued 40 heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients. The primary endpoint, progression free survival, was extended to a median of 10.2 months. The secondary endpoints demonstrated an objective response rate of 47.5%, and disease control in 30% of patients for over a year while maintaining a good quality of life. We performed comprehensive molecular, immune, microbiome, and metabolic profiling on samples of trial patients. Here, we show increased T and B cell clusters and distinct microbial patterns with amino acid and lipid metabolism are linked to exceptional clinical responses. This study suggests the immune milieu and host-microbiome can be leveraged to improve antitumor response in future immunotherapy trials.</li>

Single-cell multiomics provides comprehensive insights into gene regulatory networks, cellular diversity, and temporal dynamics. Here, we introduce nanoSPLITS (nanodroplet SPlitting for Linked-multimodal Investigations of Trace Samples), an integrated platform that enables global profiling of the transcriptome and proteome from same single cells via RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, respectively. Benchmarking of nanoSPLITS demonstrates high measurement precision with deep proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of single-cells. We apply nanoSPLITS to cyclin-dependent kinase 1 inhibited cells and found phospho-signaling events could be quantified alongside global protein and mRNA measurements, providing insights into cell cycle regulation. We extend nanoSPLITS to primary cells isolated from human pancreatic islets, introducing an efficient approach for facile identification of unknown cell types and their protein markers by mapping transcriptomic data to existing large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing reference databases. Accordingly, we establish nanoSPLITS as a multiomic technology incorporating global proteomics and anticipate the approach will be critical to furthering our understanding of biological systems.</li>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits an altered metabolic profile compared to normal pancreatic tissue. However, studies on actual pancreatic tissues are limited. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was conducted on 54 pairs of tumor and matched normal tissues. Taurine levels were validated via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on separate PDAC and normal tissues. Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data evaluated genes associated with taurine metabolism. Identified taurine-associated gene was validated through gene modulation. Clinical implications were evaluated using patient data. Metabolomics analysis showed a 2.51-fold increase in taurine in PDAC compared to normal tissues (n=54). IHC confirmed this in independent samples (n=99 PDAC, 19 normal). Bioinformatics identified 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) as a key gene modulating taurine metabolism. IHC on a tissue microarray (39 PDAC, 10 normal) confirmed elevated ADO in PDAC. The ADOTaurine axis correlated with PDAC recurrence and disease-free survival. ADO knockdown reduced cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. The MEK-related signaling pathway is suggested to be modulated by ADO-Taurine metabolism. Our multi-omics investigation revealed elevated taurine synthesis mediated by ADO upregulation in PDAC. The ADOTaurine axis may serve as a biomarker for PDAC prognosis and a therapeutic target.</li>

BACKGROUND: Aberrant glycosylation is one of the hallmarks of cancer. The profile of glycoprotein expression caused by abnormal glycosylation has been revealed, while abnormal glycogenes that may disturb the structure of glycans have not yet been identified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
METHODS: Genomic alterations driven by differentially expressed glycogenes in ESCC were compared with matched normal tissues by multi-omics analysis. Immunohistochemistry, MTT, colony formation, transwell assays, subcutaneous tumor formation experiments and tail vein injection were used to study the expression and the effect on the proliferation and metastasis of the differentially expressed glycogenes POFUT1 and RPN1 in ESCC. In the alkyne fucose labeling experiment, AAL lectin affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation were used to explore the mechanism of POFUT1 in ESCC.
RESULTS: The expression of the POFUT1 and RPN1 glycogenes were upregulated, as determined by genomic copy number gain and proteomics analysis. The overexpression of POFUT1 or RPN1 was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients and affected the proliferation and metastasis of ESCC in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression of POFUT1 increased the overall fucosylation level and activated the Notch signaling pathway, which partially mediated POFUT1 induced pro-migration in ESCC. The regulation of malignant progression of ESCC by RPN1 may be related to the TNF signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, etc. CONCLUSIONS: Our study fills a gap in the study of abnormal glycogenes and highlights the potential role of the POFUT1/Notch axis in ESCC. Moreover, our study identifies POFUT1 and RPN1 as promising anticancer targets in ESCC.</li>

Over a lifetime, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adjust their lineage output to support age-aligned physiology. In model organisms, stereotypic waves of hematopoiesis have been observed corresponding to defined age-biased HSC hallmarks. However, how the properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells change over the human lifespan remains unclear. To address this gap, we profiled individual transcriptome states of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells spanning gestation, maturation and aging. Here we define the gene expression networks dictating age-specific differentiation of HSCs and the dynamics of fate decisions and lineage priming throughout life. We additionally identifiy and functionally validate a fetal-specific HSC state with robust engraftment and multilineage capacity. Furthermore, we observe that classification of acute myeloid leukemia against defined transcriptional age states demonstrates that utilization of early life transcriptional programs associates with poor prognosis. Overall, we provide a disease-relevant framework for heterochronic orientation of stem cell ontogeny along the real time axis of the human lifespan.</li>

Although the age of the genome gave us much insight about how our organs fail with disease, it also suggested that diseases do not arise from mutations alone; rather, they develop as we age. In this Review, we examine how wound healing might act to ignite disease. Wound healing works well when we are younger, repairing damage from accidents, environmental assaults, and battles with pathogens. Yet, with age and accumulation of mutations and tissue damage, the repair process can devolve, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and neoplastic signaling. We discuss healthy wound responses and how our bodies might misappropriate these pathways in disease. Although we focus predominantly on epithelial-based (lung and skin) diseases, similar pathways might operate in cardiac, muscle, and neuronal diseases.</li>
