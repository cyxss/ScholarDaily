<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease poses a significant global public health threat with a high incidence that can result in severe mortality and disability. The lack of targeted effects from traditional therapeutic drugs on atherosclerosis may cause damage to other organs and tissues, necessitating the need for a more focused approach to address this dilemma. Micro/nanomotors are self-propelled micro/nanoscale devices capable of converting external energy into autonomous movement, which offers advantages in enhancing penetration depth and retention while increasing contact area with abnormal sites, such as atherosclerotic plaque, inflammation, and thrombosis, within blood vessel walls. Recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role micro/nanomotors play in treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, this review highlights the recent progress of micro/nanomotor technology in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including the effective promotion of micro/nanomotors in the circulatory system, overcoming hemorheological barriers, targeting the atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, and targeting intracellular drug delivery, to facilitate atherosclerotic plaque localization and therapy. Furthermore, we also describe the potential application of micro/nanomotors in the imaging of vulnerable plaque. Finally, we discuss key challenges and prospects for treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease while emphasizing the importance of designing individualized management strategies specific to its causes and microenvironmental factors.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Micro/nanomotors, Atherosclerosis, Targeted therapy, Drug delivery, Imaging</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This paper introduces the innovative use of micro/nanomotors for the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Unlike traditional therapeutic drugs, micro/nanomotors can convert external energy into autonomous movement, allowing them to penetrate deeper and remain longer at the site of atherosclerotic plaques, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and reducing off-target damage. The review highlights recent advancements in micro/nanomotor technology, including their ability to overcome hemorheological barriers, target the microenvironment of atherosclerotic plaques, and deliver drugs intracellularly. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of these devices in imaging vulnerable plaques, providing a comprehensive overview of their current applications and future prospects in personalized atherosclerosis management.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: This study explores the pathological mechanisms of atherosclerosis (AS), focusing on the role of macrophages in its formation and development, and potential therapeutic targets.
METHODS: The heterogeneity of the AS single-cell data set GSE131778 was analyzed using Seurat. Tissue sequencing data GSE28829 and GSE43292 were analyzed for immune cell abundance using CIBERSORT. Differential genes were identified, and WGCNA was used to create a coexpression network. Hub genes were identified using MCODE and CytoHubba and analyzed with GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, GSVA, and immune infiltration analysis. DrugBank identified potential drugs, and molecular docking verified drug binding to key targets. Key targets were experimentally validated.
RESULTS: Nineteen cell clusters were identified in the GSE131778 data set, classified into ten cell types. Macrophages in AS and normal tissues were identified based on cell abundance. CIBERSORT showed a significant increase in cell cluster 9 in AS samples. Thirty-two hub genes, including CD86, LILRB2, and IRF8, were validated. GO and KEGG analyses indicated Hub genes primarily affect immune functions. GSVA identified 29 significantly increased pathways in AS samples. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a positive correlation between IRF8, CD86, and LILRB2 expression and macrophage content. Molecular docking suggested CD86 as a potential drug target for AS. qRT-PCR confirmed increased IRF8 and CD86 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: CD86, LILRB2, and IRF8 are highly expressed in foam cell samples, with CD86 forming hydrogen bonds with several AS drugs, indicating CD86 as a promising target for AS treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Macrophages, Atherosclerosis, CD86, LILRB2, IRF8</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This study introduces a comprehensive approach to identify novel drug targets in atherosclerosis by integrating transcriptome features and advanced bioinformatics tools. The researchers utilized single-cell RNA sequencing data and tissue sequencing datasets to analyze the heterogeneity of cell types and identify key hub genes, particularly CD86, LILRB2, and IRF8, which are highly expressed in foam cells. The study's novelty lies in its detailed validation of these hub genes through various analytical methods, including molecular docking and experimental validation, which suggests CD86 as a promising therapeutic target due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds with several atherosclerosis drugs. This integrated approach provides a robust foundation for developing new treatments targeting macrophage-associated pathways in atherosclerosis.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:In recent years, the widespread use of bisphenol compounds and microplastics (MP) have attracted attention due to their harmful effects. Here, individual and combined effects of MP and bisphenol compounds, were assessed on adult zebrafish after co-exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol S (BPS) and 25 μm polyethylene MP. Impacts on their offspring (the F1 generation) were also investigated. The reproductive toxicity in adult zebrafish impacted exerted by bisphenol compounds were aggravated by the co-presence of MP. Transcriptomics and metabolomics further showed single or co-exposure of bisphenol compounds and MP could together regulate apoptosis, calcium signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid signaling pathways. Our results also showed the different toxicity mechanisms on transcriptional and metabolic profiles in the combination effects of bisphenol compounds and MP. The co-exposure of BPA and MP predominantly influenced neurotoxicity via the MAPK signaling pathway and voltage-dependent calcium channels, whereas the co-exposure of BPS and MP principally affected visual development through phototransduction and retinol metabolism. The co-exposure of BPA and MP, as well as BPS and MP, specifically regulate lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in zebrafish offspring, respectively. Overall, this study provided a deep understanding of the toxicity differences between co-exposure and single exposure of bisphenol compound and MP in zebrafish, as well as the transgenerational effects and potential molecular mechanisms of bisphenol compounds and MP in zebrafish offspring.</li>

<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the individual and combined effects of microplastics (MP) and bisphenol compounds (BPA and BPS) on adult zebrafish and their offspring. Using multi-omics approaches, the research reveals that co-exposure to these compounds exacerbates reproductive toxicity and affects specific signaling pathways, including apoptosis, calcium signaling, and glycerophospholipid signaling. Notably, the study identifies distinct toxicity mechanisms for BPA and BPS when co-exposed with MP, highlighting their differential impacts on neurotoxicity and visual development in zebrafish offspring. This work offers new insights into the transgenerational effects and molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of these environmental pollutants.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) has been linked to an increased risk of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unclear whether specific compounds within PM<sub>2.5</sub>, rather than the overall mass, serve as a better indicator of adverse cardiovascular health outcomes associated with air pollution.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included 3257 participants (aged 37-51 years) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its constituent compounds, black carbon (BC), ammonium, nitrate, organic matter, sulfate, mineral dust, and sea salt were included in the analyses. Carotid intima media thickness (cIMT; the average of common, bulb, and internal carotid) was measured by carotid ultrasonography. We assessed the cross-sectional associations of one-year exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its compounds with mean cIMT using linear regression models adjusting for participants' demographics, individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status, behavioral components, and health conditions. We also adopted Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to investigate the association between the PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound mixture and cIMT as well as the contribution of each compound to the association.
RESULTS: Greater exposure to BC was associated with higher cIMT (mm) (β =0.034, 95 % CI = 0.019-0.049, per IQR increase [0.56 μg/m3] of BC) among participants with a mean age of 45.0, consisting of 45.9 % Black and 54.1 % White males and females. The association was generally consistent across participants' demographic characteristics. In our BKMR analysis, BC exhibited a dose-response association with cIMT with a high contribution to the association of cIMT with PM<sub>2.5</sub> compound as a mixture (posterior inclusion probability [PIP]: 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that certain compounds of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, such as BC, may offer more reliable indications of the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:PM2.5, Black Carbon, Carotid Intima-Media Thickness</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This study advances the understanding of the relationship between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiovascular health by focusing on specific compounds within PM2.5, particularly black carbon (BC). Unlike previous studies that primarily considered the overall mass of PM2.5, this research demonstrates that exposure to BC is significantly associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), a marker of atherosclerosis. The use of Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models further highlights the dose-response relationship and the substantial contribution of BC to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on cardiovascular health. This finding suggests that targeting specific pollutants, such as BC, could be more effective in mitigating the health impacts of air pollution.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:Breast cancer in the elderly presents distinct biological characteristics and clinical treatment responses compared with cancer in younger patients. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is recommended for evaluating treatment efficacy in elderly cancer patients based on physiological classification. However, research on molecular classification in older cancer patients remains insufficient. In this study, we identified two subgroups with distinct senescent clusters among geriatric breast cancer patients through multi-omics analysis. Using various machine learning algorithms, we developed a comprehensive scoring model called "Sene_Signature," which more accurately distinguished elderly breast cancer patients compared with existing methods and better predicted their prognosis. The Sene_Signature was correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration, as supported by single-cell transcriptomics, RNA sequencing, and pathological data. Furthermore, we observed increased drug responsiveness in patients with a high Sene_Signature to treatments targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor and cell-cycle pathways. We also established a user-friendly web platform to assist investigators in assessing Sene_Signature scores and predicting treatment responses for elderly breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we developed a novel model for evaluating prognosis and therapeutic responses, providing a potential molecular classification that assists in the pre-treatment assessment of geriatric breast cancer.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Liver metastasis poses a significant barrier to effective immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as a vital supplementary therapeutic approach for these patients. However, its impact on the tumor microenvironment following the ablation of liver metastases remains unclear.
METHODS: We acquired multi-omics time-series data at 1 day, 5 days, and 14 days post-cryoablation, based on tumor and peripheral blood samples from clinical patients, cell co-culture models, and a liver metastases mouse model built on the MC38 cell line in C57BL/6 J mice. This dataset included single-cell transcriptomic sequencing, bulk tissue transcriptomic sequencing, 4D-Label-Free proteomics, flow cytometry data, western blot data, and histological immunofluorescence staining of pathological specimens.
RESULTS: We found that a neutrophil-related inflammatory state persisted for at least 14 days post-cryoablation. During this period, neutrophils underwent phenotypic changes, shifting from the N1 to the N2 type. Cryoablation also caused a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neutrophils, which triggered the formation of PAD4-dependent neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), further promoting immune evasion. Moreover, animal studies demonstrated that depleting or inhibiting the CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling axis within neutrophils, or degrading NETs, could effectively restore the host's anti-tumor immune response.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the critical role of neutrophils and their NETs in immune escape following cryoablation. Targeting the CXCL2-CXCR2-Ca2+-PAD4 axis could enhance the therapeutic response to PD-1 antibodies, providing a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes for colorectal cancer with liver metastases.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Cryoablation, Neutrophils, NETs, Immune Escape, Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This study reveals a novel mechanism by which cryoablation, a common treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastasis, induces a persistent neutrophil-related inflammatory state. Specifically, cryoablation leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels in neutrophils, triggering the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that promote immune evasion. The research also identifies the CXCL2-CXCR2-Ca2+-PAD4 axis as a key pathway in this process, suggesting that targeting this axis could enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy, particularly PD-1 antibodies, in treating colorectal cancer with liver metastases.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Sex may impact clinical outcomes in patients with stroke treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We aimed to investigate the sex differences in the short-term outcomes of DAPT within a real-world population of patients with noncardioembolic mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack.
METHODS: We performed a propensity score-matched analysis from a prospective multicentric cohort study (READAPT [Real-Life Study on Short-Term Dual Antiplatelet Treatment in Patients With Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack]) by including patients with noncardioembolic mild-to-moderate stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 0-10) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of transient ischemic attack, presence of diabetes [ABCD<sub>2</sub>] ≥4) who initiated DAPT within 48 hours of symptom onset. The primary effectiveness outcome was the 90-day risk of new ischemic stroke or other vascular events. The secondary effectiveness outcomes were the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal shift, vascular and all-cause mortality, and 24-hour early neurological improvement or deterioration. The safety outcomes included the 90-day risk of moderate-to-severe and any bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 24-hour hemorrhagic transformation. Outcomes were compared between sexes using Cox and generalized ordinal logistic regression analyses, along with calculating risk differences and ratios.
RESULTS: From 2278 patients in the READAPT study cohort, we included 1643 mild-to-moderate strokes or high-risk transient ischemic attacks treated with DAPT (mean age, 69.8±12.0 years; 34.3% women). We matched 531 women and men. The 90-day risk of new ischemic stroke or other vascular events was significantly lower among women than men (hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.28-0.99]; P=0.039). There were no significant differences in secondary effectiveness outcomes. The 90-day risk of safety outcomes was extremely low and did not differ between women and men (moderate-to-severe bleedings: 0.4% versus 0.8%; P=0.413; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage: 0.2% versus 0.4%; P=0.563). Subgroup analysis for primary effectiveness outcome showed a lower 90-day risk of new ischemic stroke or other vascular events among women aged &lt;50 years, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 0 to 5, prestroke modified Rankin Scale score &lt;2, large artery atherosclerosis cause, and no diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that women with noncardioembolic mild-to-moderate stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack treated with DAPT may have lower short-term risk of recurrent ischemic events than men. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind potential sex-based differences in outcomes after DAPT use.

<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Sex differences, Dual antiplatelet therapy, Ischemic stroke</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This paper introduces a novel analysis of sex differences in the outcomes of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for patients with noncardioembolic mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. Using a propensity score-matched analysis from the READAPT study cohort, the authors found that women had a significantly lower 90-day risk of new ischemic stroke or other vascular events compared to men. This finding highlights the importance of considering sex as a factor in treatment decisions and suggests that women may benefit more from DAPT in the short term. The study also provides insights into specific subgroups of women who may experience greater benefits, such as those under 50 years old, with milder baseline stroke severity, and without diabetes. These results contribute to a better understanding of sex-based differences in stroke outcomes and could inform future personalized treatment strategies.</li>

<li><strong>Journal</strong>: Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong>:Torres EM, Tellechea ML</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism (HT) is associated with numerous well-characterized comorbidities and established biomarkers for subclinical atherosclerosis which may lead to an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the precise molecular mechanism underlying these pathological features remains elusive. Increased levels of adipokines may have adverse effects on multiple atherosclerotic risk factors in HT. Different studies have evaluated the association between HT and adipokines with conflicting results.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to provide an overview of adipokine levels in HT. The last literature search was done in February 2024 for studies analyzing traditional and novel circulating adipokines levels (excluding resistin and irisin) in patients with HT. The standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effect models except if no heterogeneity was found.
RESULTS: HT was not associated with leptin, adiponectin, omentin-1, visfatin, or apelin levels; however, increased retinol-binding protein 4 (RPB4) levels were found in both overall and subclinical HT (p-values = 0.0002 and 0.004 respectively).
CONCLUSION: While pooled analysis suggested a role for RBP4 in hypothyroid patients, associations do not imply cause-effect relationships, and therefore the potential clinical implications of these findings should await further mechanistic studies.
REGISTRATION: The protocol has been registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the identification number CRD42024537717.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Hypothyroidism, Adipokines, Retinol-binding Protein 4</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This paper provides a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of adipokine levels in hypothyroidism (HT), focusing on both traditional and novel circulating adipokines. The key finding is that while HT is not associated with altered levels of leptin, adiponectin, omentin-1, visfatin, or apelin, there is a significant increase in retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) levels in both overt and subclinical HT. This novel association suggests a potential role for RBP4 in the pathophysiology of hypothyroidism, though further mechanistic studies are needed to establish causal relationships and clinical implications.</li>

<li><strong>Abstract</strong>:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Race and ethnicity are proxy measures of sociocultural factors that influence cognitive test performance. Our objective was to compare different regression-based cognitive normative models adjusting for demographics and different combinations of easily accessible/commonly used social determinants of health (SDoH) factors, which may help describe cognitive performance variability historically captured by ethnoracial differences.
METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses on data from Black and White participants without mild cognitive impairment/dementia in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who attended visit 5 in 2011-2013. Participants underwent a battery of 11 cognitive tests (3 domains: memory, executive function, language). We fit 6 separate normative models for each cognitive test, all including age and education, with different combinations of race, the Wide Range of Achievement Test (education quality proxy), and area deprivation index (neighborhood deprivation) associated with current residence. We compared model fits and calculated concordances/discordances between models using z-scores derived from each normative model and a z-score &lt;-1.5 threshold for impairment.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 2,392) had a mean age of 74.4 years, 60.4% were female, and 17.1% were of self-reported Black race. The "Full" model with race alongside demographic and SDoH measures consistently outperformed other nested submodels (likelihood ratios ≥ 100) for all domains/tests except Delayed Word Recall. Models with education quality alone ("WRAT") generally outperformed models with neighborhood deprivation ("ADI") or race ("Race") alone for memory and language tests while "Race" models performed better for executive function tests. Adding neighborhood deprivation to education quality ("WRAT + ADI") did not improve models vs using "WRAT" alone. Across all domains/tests, the concordance compared with the "Full" model was lower for "Education" and "ADI" models than for other nested models. Although numbers were small, there was greater discordance among Black (range = 8.2%-23.2%) compared with White (range = 2.2%-3.4%) participants, particularly for Boston Naming Test and executive function tests.
DISCUSSION: Education quality outperformed neighborhood disadvantage as an additional/alternative SDoH measure in normative models and may be useful to collect in cognitive aging studies. While performance varied across cognitive domains and tests, routinely reported SDoH variables (education level, education quality, late-life neighborhood deprivation) did not fully account for observed ethnoracial variability; future work should evaluate SDoH across the lifespan in more ethnoracially diverse populations.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>:Social Determinants of Health, Cognitive Normative Models, Race-Based Models</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>:This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating cognitive normative models by incorporating social determinants of health (SDoH) factors, such as education quality and neighborhood deprivation, instead of relying solely on race and ethnicity. The study compares various models and finds that education quality outperforms neighborhood disadvantage as an additional SDoH measure. While these SDoH variables do not fully account for the observed ethnoracial variability in cognitive performance, they offer a more nuanced understanding of cognitive test performance. This approach could lead to more equitable and accurate cognitive assessments in diverse populations.</li>
